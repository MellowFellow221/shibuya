# Corrosion

> [!NOTE] What is it
> Corrosion is the formation of a metal oxide (a film) on the surface of metals.
> Metal + oxygen • water = Metal oxide • water

Metals can oxidise in air. They react with oxygen and form metal oxides. For example, sodium is a very reactive metal.
When sodium is cut or scratched, its freshly exposed shiny surface rapidly turns dull as a thin layer of sodium oxide forms:
sodium + oxygen $\to$ sodium oxide
$4Na(s)+O_{2}(g)\to2Na_{2}O(s)$

Other metals may oxidise more slowly. Gold and other very unreactive metals do not oxidise in air or at all. Corrosion happens when a metal continues to oxidise. The metal becomes weaker over time, and eventually all of it may become metal oxide.
## Rusting
Rusting is a specific example of corrosion, which occurs when iron or steel reacts with oxygen and water:
iron + oxygen + water → hydrated iron(III) oxide
Hydrated iron(III) oxide is the orange-brown substance seen on the surface of rusty objects.

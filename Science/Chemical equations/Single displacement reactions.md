# Single Displacement Reactions
**Single Displacement Reactions** occur when one element replaces another in a compound
- A metal can replace a metal (+) *or* a non-metal can replace a non-metal (-).
$$element+compound\to element+compound$$
- $A+BC\to AC+B$ (if A is metal) *or*
- $A+BC\to BA+C$ (if A is a non-metal)
	- (remember the cation always goes first!)
When $H_{2}O$ splits into ions, it splits into $H^+$ and $OH^-$ (not $H+$ and $O^{-2}$!!)

# Double Displacement Reactions
**Double Displacement Reactions** occur when a metal replaces a metal in a compound and when a non-metal replaces a non-metal in a compound.
$$compound+compound\to compound+compound$$
- $AB+CD\to AD+CB$
- Think about it like "foil"ing in algebra, first and last ions go together + inside ions go together.
- Examples:
	- $AgNO_{3}+NaCl\to AgCl+NaNO_{3}$
	- $K_{2}SO_{4}+Ba(NO_{3})_{2}\to2KNO_{3}+BaSO_{4}$

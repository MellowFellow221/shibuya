# Combustion Reactions
- Combustion reactions occur when a hydrocarbon reacts with oxygen gas.
- This is also called burning. In order to burn something you need the 3 things in the "fire triangle":
1. A Fuel (hydrocarbon)
2. Oxygen to burn it with
3. Something to ignite the reaction (spark)

- In general: $C_{x}H_{y}+O_{2}\to CO_{2}+H_{2}O$
- Products in combustion are **always** carbon dioxide and water. (although incomplete burning does cause some by-products like carbon monoxide)

## Respiration
Cellular respiration can be considered a type of slow combustion because it involves the controlled oxidation of glucose to release energy, like how fuels burn in a fire, but at a much slower and controlled pace.

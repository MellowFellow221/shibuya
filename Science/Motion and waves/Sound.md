# Sound
Sound is a vibration that propagates through a medium in the form of a mechanical wave. The medium in which it propagates can either be a solid, a liquid or a gas. Sound travels fastest in solids, relatively slow in liquids and slowest in gases.
**In physics, sound is defined as**
- A vibration that propagates as an audible wave of pressure, through a medium such as a gas, liquid or solid.
**In psychology, sound is defined as**
- The reception of sound pressure waves and their perception by the brain.
## Key terms
- Subsonic - below 20hz
- Supersonic - past 20,000hz
- Oscilloscope - takes in sound and displays it as a wave
## What is a Sound Wave?
A sound wave is the **pattern of disturbance** caused by the energy travelling away from the source of the sound. Sound waves are **longitudinal waves**. This means that the propagation of the vibration of particles is parallel to the energy wave propagation direction. When the atoms are set in vibration they move back and forth. This continuous back and forth motion results in a high-pressure regions and termed compressions and rarefactions, respectively. These regions are transported to the surrounding medium resulting in the sound waves travelling from one medium to another.
## Nature of Sound
The sound produced by a guitar is different from the sound produced by a drum. This is because the sound is produced by different sources have different characteristics. Sound can be characterised by its frequency, wavelength, and amplitude.
### Frequency of Sound
The number of rarefactions and compressions that occur per unit time is know as the frequency of a sound wave. The formula of the frequency of a wave is given as:
$$f=\frac{1}{T}$$
Where, $f$ is the frequency of a sound wave and $T$ is the time period.
### Wavelength of Sound
The distance between the successive compression and rarefaction is know as the wavelength of a sound wave. The wavelength of the sound formula is given as follows:
$$\lambda=\frac{v}{F}$$
Where, $f$ is the frequency of a sound wave and $v$ is the velocity of the sound wave.

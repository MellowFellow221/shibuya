# Light
Things that emit light are called **Luminous** objects. These emits lights in all directions, not specific but it can be focused using other mediums.
- the Sun
- a candle
- torch
**Non-luminous** objects do not produce their own light - we see them because they reflect light from luminous objects.
- the Moon
- a book
- Eric Sun
## Material Types
- **Opaque**: An object that does not allows light to pass through.
- **Translucent**: An object that allows some light to pass through but scatters it.
- **Transparent**: An object that allows light to pass through completely.
# Interactions with light
## Reflection
Reflection is when light bounces off a surface and changes direction, usually back into the same medium.
![[Motion and waves-1748485128562.webp]]
### Key terms
- **Reflection**: When light bounces off a surface instead of passing though it.
- **Incident Ray**: the ray of light that hits a surface.
- **Reflected Ray**: The ray of light that bounces off the surface after hitting it.
- **Normal**: An imaginary line that is drawn at 90 (a right angle) to the surface where the light hits.
- **Angle of Incidence (i)**: The angle between the incident ray and the normal.
- **Angle of Reflection (r)**: The angle between the reflected ray and the normal.
### Laws of Reflection
- The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection (i = r).
- The incident ray, the reflected ray, and the normal all lie in the same plane.
## Refraction
- **Refraction**: The change in direction of light when its travelling obliquely from one medium to another (the bending of light).
- Moving from denser medium to less dense bends outwards.
- Moving from less dense medium to denser bends inwards.

## Diffraction
**What is diffraction?**
- Diffraction is the **bending or spreading of light waves** as they pass around the edges of an obstacle or through a narrow opening (slit).
**Why does it happen?**
- Light behaves like a **wave**, and waves have the ability to **bend around obstacles** or **spread out** when passing through small gaps. This is most noticeable when the size of the opening or object is similar to the **wavelength of light**.
**Key points**:
- Diffraction is a wave property of light.
- It's more noticeable with **monochromatic (single colour) light**, like laser light.
- The **smaller the slit or obstacle**, the greater the diffraction.
## Interference
**What is interference?**
- Interference occurs when **two or more light waves meet and overlap**, combining to form a new wave pattern. Depending on how the waves align, they may **reinforce** each other (constructive interference) or **cancel** each other out (destructive interference).
**Why does it happen?**
- Since light is a wave, it has crests and troughs. When two light waves meet:
	- **Constructive Interference**: crests meet crests -> brighter light.
	- **Destructive Interference**: crests meet trough -> darkness.
**Key points**:
- Requires **coherent light** - same frequency and phase (usually from a laser).
- Creates **interference patterns** - a regular sequence of **bright and dark bands**.
- Strong evidence that **light behaves as a wave**.
## Dispersion
**What is dispersion?**
- Dispersion is the **separation of white light into its component colours** (spectrum) when it passes through a **prism** or another medium, such as water or glass.
**Why does it happen?**
- White light is made up of **many colours**, each with a different **wavelength**.
- When light is refracted (bent) at a boundary (e.g., air to glass), **each wavelength bends by a different amount**.
- **Shorter wavelengths (blue/violet)** bend **more** than **longer wavelengths (red)**.
**Key points**:
- Dispersion happens due to **refraction + wavelength differences**.
- The result is a **spectrum** of colours: **Violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, red** (VIBGYOR).
- **Red light** has the **longest wavelength** (bends least), and **violet** has the **shortest** (bends most).

### Virtual Vs Real Images
- Real images form when light rays converge.
- Virtual images form when light rays seem to converge, however they do not actually converge.
## Mirror Rules
### Concave
1. Any ray of light which is parallel to the principal axis, after reflection passes through the focus.
2. Any ray of light passing though the centre of curvature is reflected back along the same path.
3. Any ray of light passing through the focus after reflection becomes parallel to the principal axis.
4. Any ray of light which is incident at the pole of concave mirror is reflected back making the same angle with the principal axis.
### Convex
1. Any ray of light which is parallel to the principal axis, after reflection it appears to be coming from the focus.
2. Any ray of light going towards the centre of curvature of a convex mirror is reflected back along the same path.
3. Any ray of light going towards the focus after reflection becomes parallel to the principal axis.
4. Any ray of light which is incident at the pole of convex mirror is reflected back making the same angle with the principal axis.
# Lenses
## Convex Lens (converging lens)
**Shape**:
- **Thicker in the middle**, thinner at the edges.
**Light behaviour**:
- **Converges (brings together)** light rays that pass through it.
- Rays parallel to the principal axis converge at the **focal point**.
**Image formation**:
- Depends on the object's distance from the lens.
- Can form **real or virtual** images.
- Real image: inverted and formed on the other side of the lens (can be projected).
- Virtual image: upright and larger (e.g., magnifying glass).
**Real-life examples**:
- Magnifying glass
- Camera lenses
- Human eye lens
- Projectors

# Light
Things that emit light are called **Luminous** objects. These emits lights in all directions, not specific but it can be focused using other mediums.
- the Sun
- a candle
- torch
**Non-luminous** objects do not produce their own light - we see them because they reflect light from luminous objects.
- the Moon
- a book
- Eric Sun
## Material Types
- **Opaque**: An object that does not allows light to pass through.
- **Translucent**: An object that allows some light to pass through but scatters it.
- **Transparent**: An object that allows light to pass through completely.
# Reflection
Reflection is when light bounces off a surface and changes direction, usually back into the same medium.

## Key terms
- **Reflection:** When light bounces off a surface instead of passing though it.
- **Incident Ray:** the ray of light that hits a surface.
- **Reflected Ray:** The ray of light that bounces off the surface after hitting it.
- **Normal:** An imaginary line that is drawn at 90 (a right angle) to the surface where the light hits.
- **Angle of Incidence (i):** The angle between the incident ray and the normal.
- **Angle of Reflection (r):** The angle between the reflected ray and the normal.
## Laws of Reflection
- The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection (i = r).
- The incident ray, the reflected ray, and the normal all lie in the same plane.

## Key terms
- **Plane Mirror**: A mirror whose reflecting surface is *flat*.
- **Curved Mirror**: A mirror whose reflecting surface is *curved*.
- **Spherical Mirror**: A specific type of curved mirror whose reflecting surface is a *part of a sphere*.
- **Concave Mirror**: A spherical mirror where the reflecting surface is *curved inwards*.
- **Convex Mirror**: A spherical mirror where the reflecting surface is *curved outwards*.
- **Pole (P)**: The *centre of the reflecting surface* of the mirror.
- **Centre of Curvature (C)**: The *centre of the sphere* that the mirror's reflecting surface is a part of.
- **Radius of Curvature**: The *radius of the sphere* that the mirror's reflecting surface is a part of.
- **Principal Axis**: A *straight line that joins the pole (P) and the centre of curvature (C).*
- **Focal Point (F)**: The *midpoint of the line segment joining the pole (P) and the centre of curvature (C).*

### Virtual Vs Real Images
- Real images form when light rays converge in front of the mirror.
- Virtual images form when light rays seem to converge behind the mirror, however they do not actually converge.
## Mirror Rules
### Concave
1. Any ray of light which is parallel to the principal axis, after reflection passes through the focus.
2. Any ray of light passing though the centre of curvature is reflected back along the same path.
3. Any ray of light passing through the focus after reflection becomes parallel to the principal axis.
4. Any ray of light which is incident at the pole of concave mirror is reflected back making the same angle with the principal axis.
### Convex
1. Any ray of light which is parallel to the principal axis, after reflection it appears to be coming from the focus.
2. Any ray of light going towards the centre of curvature of a convex mirror is reflected back along the same path.
3. Any ray of light going towards the focus after reflection becomes parallel to the principal axis.
4. Any ray of light which is incident at the pole of convex mirror is reflected back making the same angle with the principal axis.
# Refraction
- **Refraction**: The change in direction of light when its travelling obliquely from one medium to another (the bending of light).

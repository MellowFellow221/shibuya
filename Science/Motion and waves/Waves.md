# Waves
**What is a wave?** - rhythmic disturbances that carry energy through matter or space.
**What is a medium?** - material through which a wave transfers energy. Solid, liquid, gas or combination. Electromagnetic waves don't need a medium (e.g. visible light)
## Measuring Waves
Reading a transverse wave.

Reading a longitudinal wave.

### Amplitude
The **amplitude** of a wave is the **maximum displacement** of a point on a wave away from its undisturbed position. The furthest point the wave vibrates from its undisturbed position.
### Wavelength (λ)
The wavelength of a wave is the **distance** from a **point on one wave** to the **equivalent point** on the adjacent wave.
If we take a point on one wave, e.g. the top, and then measure the **distance** to the **same point** on the **next wave** then that is the wavelength.
The symbol for wavelength is the Greek letter **lambda (λ)**.
### Frequency (f)
Number of waves passing a point in 1 second
- Hertz (Hz)
- f = 1/T
- shorter wavelength -> higher frequency -> higher energy
### Velocity (v)
Speed of a wave as it moves forward
- depends on wave type and medium

- v: veleocity (m/s)
- λ: wavelength (m)
- f: frequency (Hz)
## Mechanical Vs Non-mechanical Waves
- Mechanical requires a medium (e.g. sound waves)
- Non-mechanical waves don't require a medium allowing them to move through a vacuum (e.g. electromagnetic waves)

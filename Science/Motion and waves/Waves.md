# Waves
**What is a wave?** - rhythmic disturbances that carry energy through matter or space.
**What is a medium?** - material through which a wave transfers energy. Solid, liquid, gas or combination. Electromagnetic waves don't need a medium (e.g. visible light)

> [!NOTE]
> A wave can be described as a disturbance that travels through a medium from one location to another location without transporting any matter.
> **Mechanical wave** - The disturbance is travelling through a medium (solid, liquid, or gas)

## Types of Waves
### Transverse Wave
**Transverse waves** are a type of wave in which the disturbance is carried forward and the particles undergo to and fro motion only about their mean position. These waves, move from one end to the other, while the particle motion which makes the wave is perpendicular to the direction of the propagation of the wave. Particles in the medium in a transverse wave move in one direction which is perpendicular to the direction of the wave propagation, also it oscillate about the mean position that is to and fro motion.

### Longitudinal Waves
**Longitudinal waves** are a type of wave where the disturbance is carried forward while the motion of the particle of the medium is in the direction which is parallel to the direction of propagation of the wave. A series of compressions and rarefactions is created. Wave motion, in this case, is in one direction.

## Measuring Waves
### Amplitude
The **amplitude** of a wave is the **maximum displacement** of a point on a wave away from its undisturbed position. The furthest point the wave vibrates from its undisturbed position.
### Wavelength ($\lambda$)
The wavelength of a wave is the **distance** from a **point on one wave** to the **equivalent point** on the adjacent wave.
If we take a point on one wave, e.g. the top, and then measure the **distance** to the **same point** on the **next wave** then that is the wavelength.
The symbol for wavelength is the Greek letter **lambda ($\lambda$)**.
### Frequency ($f$)
Number of waves passing a point in 1 second
- Hertz (Hz)
- $f = \frac{1}{T}$
- shorter wavelength -> higher frequency -> higher energy
### Velocity (v)
Speed of a wave as it moves forward
- depends on wave type and medium

- $v$: velocity (m/s)
- $\lambda$: wavelength (m)
- $f$: frequency (Hz)
## Mechanical Vs Non-mechanical Waves
- Mechanical requires a medium (e.g. sound waves)
- Non-mechanical waves don't require a medium allowing them to move through a vacuum (e.g. electromagnetic waves)

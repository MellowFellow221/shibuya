# Phosphorus Cycle
![[Phosphorus Cycle-20241212095127066.webp]]
## Definition
- The phosphorus cycle is the biogeochemical cycle (how phosphorus is in between life and earth) that describes the movement of phosphorus through the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere.
- The atmosphere doesn't play a significant role in phosphorus because phosphorus compounds are solids during the typical ranges of temperature and pressure found on Earth
## Explanation of the Cycle
- Rocks start out the Phosphorus Cycle.
- When it rains, phosphates are removed from the rocks and are spread out through both soils and water.
- Plants use up phosphate ions from the soil.
- Phosphate moves from the plants to animals when herbivores eat plants and carnivores eat plants or herbivores.
- Animals release the phosphate into the ground.
- It is then decomposed by bacteria and fungi.
- It then goes through the soil or releases into the water.
- As the rocks are forming they will either join with phosphate or the phosphate will go into the roots of plants and start the cycle over again.
## Facts
- Humans can alter the phosphorus cycle by the cutting of tropical rain forests and through the use of agricultural fertilizers.
- Agricultural runoff provides much of the phosphate found in waterways.
- At one time the use of laundry detergents contributed to significant concentrations of phosphates in rivers, lakes, and streams, but most detergents no longer include phosphorus as an ingredient.
- Phosphorus is one of the most limiting elements in the ecological system.
- Phosphorus is involved in energy transfer and in the ecological system.
- Phosphorus is involved in energy transfer and in the passage of the genetic information in the DNA.
- Because of phosphorus' high reactivity, it exists in combined forms of other elements.
- Like calcium, phosphorus is important to the vertebrates. In the human body, 80% of phosphorus is found in teeth and bones.

### SIde Notes
- Doesn't exist in the atmosphere like the other cycles
- Moves slower than the other cycles as it is a sedimentary cycle
- In soil is mainly taken by plants and animals when eaten
- Vital in cell membranes in DNA and is needed for growth and sustenance for teeth and bones.
- Nutrient for all life on earth
- Does not exist as a gas in the atmosphere
- Weathering and erosion of rocks rich in phosphates move it into the soil
- Phosphates are mainly found in Apatite

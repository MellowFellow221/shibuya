# Carbon Cycle
- Sources of carbon:
	- Rocks. soil
	- Any living organisms (Organic!)
- How can we reduce $CO_2$
- Effect of $CO_2$
- The same carbon atoms are used repeatedly on earth, cycling between the earth and the atmosphere.
- Carbon moves from one storage reservoir
## Plants and the Carbon Cycle
- Plants pull carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into the biosphere, using it to make food through he process of Photosynthesis.
- The carbon becomes part of the plant and is stored as Starch the leaves, stems or roots of the plant.
- Thus entering the food chain.
## Animals and the Carbon Cycle
- When organisms eat plants, they take in the carbon and some of it becomes part of their own bodies.=
- All animals that eat plants digest the sugar molecules to get energy for their bodies.
- Respiration, excretion, and decomposition release the carbon back into the atmosphere or soil, continuing the cycle.
- When humans consumer plants and animals we add to this cycling of matter.
## Plants and Animal Life Cycles
- When plants and animals die, most of their bodies are decomposed and carbon atoms are returned to the atmosphere.
- Some are not decomposed fully and end up in deposits underground
## What is Carbon?
- Carbon is the chemical backbone of life on Earth.
- It is found in all living (organic matter) things on Earth
- It can be found in rocks, ocean, atmosphere
- Carbon compounds regulate the Earth's temperature, make up the food that sustains us, and provide energy that fuels our global economy.

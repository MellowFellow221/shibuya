# Spheres of the Earth
- Earth is divided into 4 spheres:
	1. Lithosphere
	2. Hydrosphere
	3. Biosphere
	4. Atmosphere
## Lithosphere
- This is the solid, rocky crust covering the entire planet.
- Is the Earth's crust and the upper layer of semi-molten mantle
- Broken into large pieces called tectonic plates
- Consists of rocks, soil, sand, minerals, coal, oil and natural gas
## Hydrosphere
- Composed of all the water on or near the Earth. Includes;
	- Earth's oceans
	- Lakes
	- Rivers and creeks
	- Moisture in the air
- 97% of Earth's water is in the ocean
- 3% is fresh water, 75% of this is solid in ice sheets
## Biosphere
- This is composed of all living organisms.
	- Plants, animals, and one-celled organisms
- Most life is found from 3m below the ground to thirty meters above it and in the top 200m of the oceans and seas.
## Atmosphere
- This is the body of air which surrounds our planet
- Consists of four layers:
	1. Troposphere
	2. Stratosphere
	3. Mesosphere
	4. Thermosphere (including ionosphere)
**Composition:**
- 78% Nitrogen
- 21% Oxygen
- 1% Trace Gases (mainly Argon)

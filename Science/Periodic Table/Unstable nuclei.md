# Radioactivity
![[Radioactivity#What is 'radiation']]
- We can't predict exactly when an atom will decay
	- For how large #'s of atoms, we **can** predict how many will decay on average in a given amount of time.
## Which Elements Are Radioactive?
- All elements past Bismuth in the periodic table.
- If the atomic number is >83, it's radioactive
- Other elements may have radioactive isotopes.
- Stability depends on neutron/proton ratio.
## What's Going on in the Nucleus?
- **Electrostatic repulsions** between **protons**. Want to fly apart.
- But *protons & neutrons* all attracted to each other by *nuclear strong force*.
- So having neutrons helps hold a nucleus together.

### Strong Force
- Works best if the nucleus isn't too large.
- As the nucleus gets larger, need to have more neutrons to help counteract the electrostatic repulsion between the protons.
- Eventually, the nucleus is too large to be stable.
### Balancing Act
- balance exists between electrostatic repulsive force & nuclear strong force.
- Certain #'s of protons & neutrons make a stable nucleus. Other #'s of protons & neutrons are unstable. So the atom decays.

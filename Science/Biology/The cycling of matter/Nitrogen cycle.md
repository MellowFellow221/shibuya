# Nitrogen Cycle
![[Nitrogen cycle-20241212101847082.webp]]
- A repeating cycle of processes during which nitrogen moves through both living and non-living things: the atmosphere, soil, water, plants, animals and bacteria.
- In order to move through the different parts of the cycle, nitrogen must change forms.
- In the atmosphere, nitrogen exists as a has($N_2$), but in the soil it exists as nitrogen oxide ($NO$) and nitrogen dioxide ($NO_2$).
- When used as a fertilizer, it can be found in other forms, such as ammonia ($NH_3$) which can be processed even further into a different fertilizer ammonium nitrate ($NH_4NO_3$)
## Stages
### Stage 1 Fixation
- About 78% of the air is nitrogen gas.
- Nitrogen is too unreactive to be used directly by plants to make protein. It must be converted into soluble ions, such as nitrates.
- **Nitrogen-fixing bacteria** in root nodules help convert Nitrogen in the air into Nitrates.
- **Lightning** can also convert nitrogen gas into nitrates.
- The **Haber process** converts nitrogen gas into **ammonia** for use in fertilisers.
- **Nitrifying bacteria** in the soil can also convert ammonium ions into nitrates.
### Stage 2 Nitrification (Absorption)
- **Absorption of nitrates into roots and incorporation into plants.** Plants absorb nitrates from the soil and use these to make proteins.
### Stage 3 Assimilation (into Food chains)
- **Nitrates moving along food chains and excretion.** When an animal eats a plant, nitrogen from the plant's proteins becomes proteins in the animal. Nitrogen is also passed from one animal to another by feeding.
### Stage 4 Ammonification
- **Death of animals. Decomposers** break down **urea, egested material** (eg. faeces) and dead bodies. This results in nitrogen being returned to the soil as ammonium ions, which nitrifying bacteria can convert into nitrates for plants to absorb.
### Stage 5 De-nitrification
- **Release of Nitrogen back into atmosphere. De-nitrifying bacteria** in the soil break down nitrates and return nitrogen gas to the air.
## Nitrogen and Us
- Nitrogens is the most abundant element in our atmosphere with Nitrogen gas making up 78% of out Atmosphere.
- It is also a key element in the nucleic acids **DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid)** a self replicating material present in nearly all living things, found on the chromosomes in the nucleus of cells and **RNA (Ribonucleic acid)** an acid present in all living things which acts as a messenger carrying instructions from DNA.
- DNA carries the genetic information, which means the instructions for how to make up a life form.
## Nitrogen and Plants
- Plants require nitrogen, to **produce Amino Acids** (substances that contain nitrogen and hydrogen and make up many of living cells, muscles and tissue).
- Without amino acids, plants cannot make the special proteins that the plant cells need to grow.
- With too much nitrogen, plants produce excess biomass (organic matter) such as stalks and leaves, but not enough root structure.
- In extreme cases, plants with very high levels of nitrogen absorbed from soils can poison farm animals that eat them.

# Balancing Equations
Sulphuric acid + Sodium hydroxide -> Sodium sulphate + water
$$
H_{2}SO_{4}+2NaOH \to Na_{2}SO_{4}+2H_{2}O
$$
1. During a chemical reaction, the number of atoms on reactant side must be the same as the number of products side, due to the 'Law of conservation of matter'

| Non-metal atoms join with other non-metal atoms forming small molecules known as molecular. | Metals join with non-metal ions (mono atomic such as $Cl^-$ or poly atomic such as $OH^-$) forming ionic compounds. | When the ionic form of the reactants (both) and products stated so that the number of ions on reactants and products are demonstrated. |

Check how many of each element is on each side of the equation then add elements on both sides until it is balanced.

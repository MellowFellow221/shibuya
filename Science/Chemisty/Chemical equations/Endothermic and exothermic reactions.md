# Endothermic and Exothermic Reactions
- Based on the type of energy (heat) change involved, chemical reactions are classified as either *exothermic* or *endothermic*.
**Endothermic:** Energy must be *supplied* to break chemical bonds of reactants.
	Endo- = "into"
**Exothermic:** Energy is *released* when new chemical bonds are made in the products.
	Exo- = "exit"

> [!NOTE] Difference
> Reaction is exothermic if more energy is released than supplied. If more energy is supplied than is released then the reaction is endothermic.

## Activation Energy
- The energy required to break the bonds in the reactants for a chemical reaction to occur.

# Chemical Reactions
## Steps to Writing Reactions
1. Identify the type of reaction
2. Predict the product(s) using the type of reaction as a model
3. [[Balancing equations |Balance it]]
Don't forget about the diatomic elements! (BrINClHOF). For example, Oxygen is $O_{2}$ as an element
In a compound, it can't be a diatomic element because it's not an element anymore, it's a compound!
## Types of Reactions
- There are six types of chemical reactions we will talk about:
	1. [[Synthesis reactions]]
	2. [[Decomposition reactions]]
	3. [[Single displacement reactions]]
	4. [[Double displacement reactions]]
	5. [[Combustion reactions]]
	6. [[Neutralisation reactions]]
	7. [[Precipitation reactions]]
- You need to be able to identify the type of reaction and predict the product(s)

| Type of Reaction    | General reaction                                      | Explanation                                                                             |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Synthesis           | $A+B\to AB$                                           | Two or more elements or compounds combine to form one compound.                         |
| Decomposition       | $AB\to A+B$                                           | A complex molecule breaks into simpler ones.                                            |
| Single displacement | $A+BC\to AC+B$                                        | One element replaces another in a compound.                                             |
| Double displacement | $AB+CD\to AD+CB$                                      | Cations and anions exchange partners.                                                   |
| Combustion          | $C_{x}H_{y}+O_{2}\to CO_{2}+H_{2}O$                   | A compound combines with oxygen to form an oxide. Often, carbon dioxide and water form. |
| Neutralisation      | $acid+base\to salt+water$                             | An acid and base react to form a salt and water.                                        |
| Precipitation       | A + Soluble salt B $\to$ Precipitate + soluble salt C | Two solutions of soluble salts react to form an insoluble salt (a precipitate).         |

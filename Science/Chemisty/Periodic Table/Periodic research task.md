# Radioactivity
## Define what a Radioisotope is
**Isotope:** An isotope is a variant of a chemical element that has the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons in its nucleus. Because the number of protons (also known as the atomic number) defines the element, isotopes of an element share the same chemical properties but can have different physical properties due to the difference in mass.
- Variant of an element
- Differing number of neutrons
- Same chemical properties different physical properties
**Radioisotope:** A radioisotope (or radioactive isotope) is a variant of a chemical element that has an unstable nucleus and emits radiation during its decay to a stable form. This instability arises because the nucleus has an imbalance in the number of protons and neutrons or too much energy.
- Isotope for radioactive elements
## Graphing and Interpreting Radioactive Decay
All radioactive decay graphs will have the same pattern of exponential decay, where the y values continually approach zero as the x values increase. The x-values can either be in terms of half-lives, or years. The y-values should be in terms of mass (grams/milligrams) of the element that is decaying.

# Models of the Atom
*John Dalton:*
1. **Solid sphere model:**
Atoms are indivisible, those given to elements are identical and compounds are combinations of different types of atoms.
2. **How do technologies further atomic theory: cause of the furthering and effect of it**
Dalton discovered that oxygen combined with either one or two volumes of nitric oxide in closed vessels over water. This discovery supported the idea that gasses are matter made of atoms, and that different gasses were made of different types of atoms.
3. **What's right what's wrong**
Recognised atoms of a particular element differ from other elements
Atoms aren't indivisible and are composed of subatomic particles

*J.J Tomson:*
1. **Plum pudding model:**
Atoms are composed of electrons (negatively charged) scattered throughout a spherical cloud of positive charge.
2. **How do technologies further atomic theory: cause of the furthering and effect of it**
Discovered electrons using a cathode ray which ejected atoms from a neutral element and showed they were negatively charged, meaning atoms must have both positively and negatively charged atoms within them.
3. **What's right what's wrong**
Recognised electrons as parts of the atom
No nucleus

*Ernest Rutherford:*
1. **Nuclear model:**
Atoms have a positively charged centre (nucleus) which electrons orbited.
2. **How do technologies further atomic theory: cause of the furthering and effect of it**
Discovered alpha, beta and gamma rays by shooting particles at gold foil, with a small chance that alpha particles would hit a nucleus and bounce off. Suggesting positive charges are condensed in the centre with electrons orbiting.
3. **What's right what's wrong**
Realised positive charge was localised in the nucleus of an atom
Didn't explain why electrons remain orbiting

*Niels Bohr:*
1. **Planetary model**
Atoms move around the nucleus in orbits of fixed sizes and energies
2. **How do technologies further atomic theory: cause of the furthering and effect of it**
Found a discrepancy that using the nuclear model at some point the electron would lose energy and collapse into the nucleus. Proposing stable electron orbits.
3. **What's right what's wrong**
Proposed stable electron obits
Model didn't work well for heavier atoms

*Erwin Schrodinger:*
1. **Quantum model**
Electrons don't move in paths around the nucleus but in waves. There is a cloud of probability where we are more likely to find an electron, we can't tell the exact location of electrons.
2. **How do technologies further atomic theory: cause of the furthering and effect of it**
Fixed the atom not satisfying the uncertainty principle. Creating the cloud of probability and understating electrons move in waves.
3. **What's right what's wrong**
Shows electrons don't move in orbits but in cloud where their position is uncertain
# Graphing
1. Use pencil + ruler + rubber
2. A single, smooth line
	- Do not extend your graph beyond your 1st + last point
3. Clearly labelled axis + units
4. Line of best fit
5. Estimate information from graphs

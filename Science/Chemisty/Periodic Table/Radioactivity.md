# What is 'radiation'

> [!Note] Nuclear radiation
> The term **radiation** (also known as **nuclear radiation**) refers to the particles or waves emitted by radioactive substances.

Nuclear radiation comes from the nucleus of a radioactive atom.

An atom is unstable, and therefore radioactive, if the nucleus has an excess of internal energy. This is due to an atoms having too many protons, too many neutrons or simply too much energy so it emits particles or waves to form a more stable atom.

Therefore most radioactive elements come later in the periodic table, being very heavy. Having so much material in them they are more likely to want to lose pieces of themselves becoming radioactive.

This process is called **radioactivity** or **radioactive decay**. It is a natural and completely spontaneous process.

- Nucleus of an element spontaneously emits subatomic particles & electromagnetic waves.
- Nucleus changes into a different element when it does this.
- Original nucleus is called "unstable"
- Process is called "**decay**" or "**transmutation**."
# How is Radiation Detected
The effects of radiation can be seen and so it can be detected using instruments such as a **Geiger–Müller tube**.

This is a device that can detect and measure radiation.

# The Periodic Table
- Is an arrangement of elements in which the elements are separated into **groups** based on a set of **repeating properties**
![[History of the periodic table-20241031094938159.webp]]
## Expansion of the Elements
- French scientist **Lavoisier** complied a list of all the know elements.
	- Contained **33** elements **organized into four categories**.
- The advent of **electricity and the Industrial revolution** played a large role in the discovery of new elements.
- By 1870, there were approximately **70 known elements**.
### Mendeleev's Table
- Russian chemist, **Dmitri Mendeleev**, demonstrated a connection between **atomic mass and elemental properties**.
- When elements were **ordered by increasing atomic mass**, there was a periodic **pattern in their properties**.
- **Mendeleev** arranged the **elements in order of increasing atomic mass** into columns.
	- Similar properties appeared at regular intervals.
- Noting the similar properties and trends, he was able to **predict the properties of the yet-to-be-discovered** elements scandium, gallium and germanium.
### Moseley's Corrections
- Mendeleev's table wasn't completely correct.
	- Arranging elements by mass resulted in several elements being placed in groups of elements with different properties.
- **Mosely** - 1913:
	- Arranged the elements according to:
		1. Increasing **atomic number**.
		2. Elements with **similar properties** were put in the **same column**.
## Periodic Law
- After 1913 scientists were able to organize the **table based on atomic number** (# of protons).
- Periodic Law:
	- When elements are arranged in order of **increasing** atomic number, there is a periodic **repetition of their physical and chemical properties**.
- This law produced the modern periodic table.
# Periodic Table Map
- The table is a map to ANY element.
- You can find an element if you know:
	1. **Atomic number**.
	2. **Period** and **group** number.
		- **Period**: The horizontal rows (left to right).
		- **Group**: vertical columns (top to bottom).
			- Also called "Families".
- Beginning with hydrogen in period 1, there are a total of **7 periods**.
	- During electron configuration we called the periods the "principle energy level"!
- Each group is numbered **1-18**.
	- Elements in groups 1, 2, and 13-18 possess a wide range of chemical and physical properties.
		- These are known as the "**main group**" or "**representative**" elements.
	- Elements in groups 3-12 are referred to as **transition** elements.
		- Classified as metals, non-metals, and metalloids.
# Properties
## Properties of Metals
- **Generally shiny** when smooth and clean.
- **Solid at room temperature**.
- Good conductors of **heat and electricity**.
- Most are **malleable** and ductile.
- **~80%** of the periodic table is metallic.
- **Alkali Metals**:
	- Except for hydrogen, Group 1 elements.
	- Highly reactive and usually exist as compounds with other elements.
- **Alkaline Earth Metals**:
	- Group 2.
	- Highly reactive.

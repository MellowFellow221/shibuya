# Characteristics of Radiation
## Alpha (α)

| Description                       | 2 neutrons, 2 protons<br><br>Note: An alpha particle is the same as a helium nucleus. |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Electric charge                   | +2                                                                                    |
| Relative atomic mass              | 4                                                                                     |
| Penetrating power                 | Stopped by paper or a few centimetres of air                                          |
| Ionizing effect                   | Strongly ionizing (strongly able to remove efrom other atoms)                       |
| Effect of magnetic/electric field | Weakly deflected                                                                      |

## Beta (β)

| Description                       | High energy electron                      |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Electric charge                   | -1                                        |
| Relative atomic mass              | 1/1860                                    |
| Penatrating power                 | Stopped by a few millimetres of aluminium |
| Ionizing effect                   | Weakly ionizing                           |
| Effect of magnetic/electric field | Strongly deflected                        |

## Gamma (γ)

| Description                       | Electro-magnetic wave                      |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Electric charge                   | 0                                          |
| Relative atomic mass              | 0                                          |
| Penatrating power                 | Stopped by several centimetres of concrete |
| Ionizing effect                   | Very weakly ionizing                       |
| Effect of magnetic/electric field | Not deflected                              |

# What is a Half Life
Half life is the amount of time it takes for half of something to decay (normally a radioactive element).

> [!Symbol]
> The half life symbol is $t_{1/2}$

# Patterns and Information
There is no pattern when it comes to half lives, small differences can change the half lives dramatically. Beta+ emitters always have fairly short half lives.

The half life of a radionuclide isn't effected by anything. Heating, cooling and everything else has no effect on it.

Generally the shorter the half life the more production of radiation. A high activity results in a shorter half-life.

> [!Activity]
> The number of decays that occur per second.
> The unit for measurement is becquerels/gram.
>
> The activity of an actual sample:
> Activity = activity/gram * number of grams

## Example
This is a graph of the decay of cobalt-60.

It has a half life of 5.27yrs so with a mass starting at 10g after one half life (5.27yrs) it will end up at 5g then after another half life it will end up at 2.5g.

10g -> 5g -> 2.5g -> 1.25g -> 0.625g -> â€¦

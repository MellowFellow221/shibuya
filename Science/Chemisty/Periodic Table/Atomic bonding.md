# Atomic Bonding
There are 3 types of bonding between atoms
1. Metallic bonding
	- Exists only among the metals. Atoms are immersed in a sea of electrons, 'electron sea model'
2. Ionic bonding
	- Exists between a metal and a non-metal
3. Covalent bonding
	- Exists between two non-metals
## Metallic Bonding

## Ionic Bonding
- forms ionic **compounds**
- transfer of e- (electrons)

> [!NOTE] Ionic bond
> Giving and accepting electrons

The transfer of electrons between two atoms, which are metal and non-metal.
This is due to the metal trying to stabilize getting rid of valence electrons in an unfilled ring.

When metals lose electrons they become 'Cations' ðŸ˜º
When non-metals gain electrons they become negatively charged 'Anions'
## Covalent Bonding
- Forms molecules
- Sharing e-

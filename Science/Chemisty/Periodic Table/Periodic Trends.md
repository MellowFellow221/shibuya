# Periodic Trends

***Groups and Periods of the Periodic Table***

Elements are arranged in rows and columns in the periodic table in order of increasing atomic mass. The vertical columns are called **groups** and the horizontal rows are called **periods**. Li, Na and K are in the same group while N, O, F are in the same period.

Elements in the same groups have the same number of electrons in their outer shells. For example, all the elements in Group VII have 7 electrons on their outer shells. Elements in the same groups have similar chemical and physical properties

Some groups have specific names:
- Group 1 elements are called Alkali,
- Group 2 Alkali Earth metal,
- Group 7 – halogen,
- Group 0Noble Gases.
Elements in the same period have the same number of outer shells.

1. ***Atomic number and Mass number***

By looking at the Periodic Table;

**What happens to the Atomic number as you move down any group?**

**What happens to the Atomic number as you move across any period?**

**Is the trend the same for Mass number? Why does this happen?**

1. ***Atomic Radius***

By looking at the Bohr drawing of the first 20 elements;

**What happens to the Atomic structure as you move down any group?**

**What happens to the Atomic structure as you move across any period? Predict how the size of the atom changes?**

1. Down the group \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

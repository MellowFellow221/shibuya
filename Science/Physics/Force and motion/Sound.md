# Sound
Sound is a vibration that propagates through a medium in the form of a mechanical wave. The medium in which it propagates can either be a solid, a liquid or a gas. Sound travels fastest in solids, relatively slow in liquids and slowest in gases.
**In physics, sound is defined as**
- A vibration that propagates as an audible wave of pressure, through a medium such as a gas, liquid or solid.
**In psychology, sound is defined as**
- The reception of sound pressure waves and their perception by the brain.
## Key terms
- Subsonic - below 20 Hz
- Supersonic - past 20,000 Hz
- Oscilloscope - takes in sound and displays it as a wave
## What is a Sound Wave?
A sound wave is the **pattern of disturbance** caused by the energy travelling away from the source of the sound. Sound waves are **longitudinal waves**. This means that the propagation of the vibration of particles is parallel to the energy wave propagation direction. When the atoms are set in vibration they move back and forth. This continuous back and forth motion results in a high-pressure regions and termed compressions and rarefactions, respectively. These regions are transported to the surrounding medium resulting in the sound waves travelling from one medium to another.
## Nature of Sound
The sound produced by a guitar is different from the sound produced by a drum. This is because the sound is produced by different sources have different characteristics. Sound can be characterised by its frequency, wavelength, and amplitude.
### Frequency of Sound
The number of rarefactions and compressions that occur per unit time is know as the frequency of a sound wave. The formula of the frequency of a wave is given as:
$$f=\frac{1}{T}$$
Where, $f$ is the frequency of a sound wave and $T$ is the time period.
### Wavelength of Sound
The distance between the successive compression and rarefaction is know as the wavelength of a sound wave. The wavelength of the sound formula is given as follows:
$$\lambda=\frac{v}{F}$$
Where, $f$ is the frequency of a sound wave and $v$ is the velocity of the sound wave.
### Amplitude of Sound
The amplitude of the sound is the magnitude of the maximum disturbance in a sound wave. The amplitude is also a measure of energy. Higher the amplitude is the higher the energy in a sound wave. Humans can only hear a limited range of frequencies of sound. Physicists have identified the audio frequency spectrum of the human ear to be between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Under ideal laboratory conditions, the human ear can detect frequencies that are as low as 12 Hz and as high as 20,000 Hz.
### Speed of Sound
The speed at which sound waves propagate through a medium is known as the speed of sound. The speed of sound is different in different mediums. The speed of sound is highest in solids because the atoms in solids are highly compressed. The interaction between atoms in a particles is highly dependent on the distance between them. Higher the interaction between the atoms, the faster the energy is transferred. As the interaction of the particles in solids is high, the pseed of sound is faster than liquids and gases. The table below lists the speed of sounds in different mediums. The formula used to calculate the speed of sound is given as:
$$c=\frac{d}{t}$$
Where, d is the distance travelled by sound and t is the time taken to cover the distance.

| Medium   | Speed of sound |
| -------- | -------------- |
| Water    | 1481 m/s       |
| Air      | 343.2 m/s      |
| Copper   | 4600 m/s       |
| Hydrogen | 1270 m/s       |
| Glass    | 4540 m/s       |

# Newton's Laws
## First Law (law of inertia)
Newton's First Law of Motion, also known as the **Law of Inertia**, is a fundamental principle that describes the behaviour of objects in the absence of external influences. The term "Law of Inertia" emphasises the concept of inertia, which refers to the property of massive objects to resist changes in their state of motion. This idea stems from the observation that objects naturally maintain their current state of rest or motion, resisting nay changes unless acted upon by an external force.
By naming the first law of motion the "Law of Inertia", Newton highlighted this inherent property of objects and laid the groundwork for understanding how forces can cause changes in motion. **Newton's first law of motion states that objects persist in their current state of motion unless compelled to do otherwise by an external force. Whether an object is at rest or in uniform motion, it will continue in that state unless a net external force acts upon it.**

One crucial insight provided by Newton's First Law is that the object will maintain a constant velocity in the absence of a net force resulting from unbalanced forces acting on an object.

Objects at rest stay at rest + Objects in motion stay in motion at the same velocity UNTIL an unbalanced force acts on it!

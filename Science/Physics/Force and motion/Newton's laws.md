# Newton's Laws
## Laws of Motion Summary
The flow chart highlights the three laws of motion established by Sir Isaac Newton:
1. **Newton's First Law of Motion**: The law of inertia states that an object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will continue moving with a constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force.
2. **Newton's Second Law of Motion**: This law relates the force acting on an object to its mass and acceleration. The force is equal to the product of mass and acceleration, where acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.
3. **Newton's Third Law of Motion**: The law of action and reaction states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When one body exerts a force on another body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force of the same magnitude but in the opposite direction of the first body.

## First Law (law of inertia)
Newton's First Law of Motion, also known as the **Law of Inertia**, is a fundamental principle that describes the behaviour of objects in the absence of external influences. The term "Law of Inertia" emphasises the concept of inertia, which refers to the property of massive objects to resist changes in their state of motion. This idea stems from the observation that objects naturally maintain their current state of rest or motion, resisting nay changes unless acted upon by an external force.
**Newton's first law of motion states that objects persist in their current state of motion unless compelled to do otherwise by an external force. Whether an object is at rest or in uniform motion, it will continue in that state unless a net external force acts upon it.**

One crucial insight provided by Newton's First Law is that the object will maintain a constant velocity in the absence of a net force resulting from unbalanced forces acting on an object. If the object is already in motion, it will continue moving at the same speed and direction. Likewise, if the object is at rest, it will remain stationary. However, introducing an additional external force will cause the object's velocity to change, responding to the magnitude and direction of the force applied.

Objects at rest stay at rest + Objects in motion stay in motion at the same velocity UNTIL an unbalanced force acts on it!
## Second Law
The second law of motion describes the relationship between the force acting on a body and the resulting acceleration. According to Newton's second law, the force acting on an object is equal to the product of its mass and acceleration.
Mathematically, we express Newton's Second Law as follows:
$$
\large
F=m\times a
$$
Here, F represents the force, m is the object's mass and a is the acceleration produced. This equation reveals that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the magnitude of the net force applied i the same direction as the force and inversely proportional to the object's mass.

## Third Law
Newton's Third Law of Motion states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When two bodies interact, the apply forced on each other that are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. This law highlights the concept that forces always occur in pairs.

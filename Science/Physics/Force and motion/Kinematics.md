# Kinematics
Earth's acceleration to gravity:
$$
\large
g = 9.8\frac{m}{s^2}
$$
## Distance and displacement
The magnitude of length covered by a moving object is called **distance**. It has no direction.
**Displacement** is the shortest distance between two points or the distance between the starting and final positions with respect to time. It has magnitude as well as direction.
Displacement can be zero, but distance cannot.

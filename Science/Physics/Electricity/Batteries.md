# Voltage Ratings
Batteries convert stored chemical energy into electrical energy.
Manufactures rate a battery by assigning a voltage.

> [!The Push]
> Remember that voltage is the "push" it exerts on [[Charges]] in the circuits. A bigger voltage means a bigger "push", which results in a larger current.

A battery's voltage depends on its chemical components, as shown in the table.

| single use batteries |      |
| -------------------- | ---- |
| alkaline             | 1.5V |
| silver-oxide         | 1.6V |
| lithium              | 3.6V |

| rechargeable batteries |      |
| --------------------- | ---- |
| lead acid             | 2V   |
| nickel based          | 1.2V |
| lithium-ion           | 3.6V |

Larger batteries can also be manufactured by joining cells together in series.

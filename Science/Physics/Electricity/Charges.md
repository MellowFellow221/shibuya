# Electrical charge
Matter is made up of atoms, which contain three smaller particles.
- Protons - positively charged
- Neutrons - neutral
- Electrons - negatively charged
## Charged Atoms
Atoms have a neutral charge, but if they lose an electron they become positively charged and if they gain an electron they become negatively charged.

> [!Note]
> Charged atoms are called ions.
> Cations - +charged
> Anion - -charged

# Static Electricity
Static electricity allows charged objects to affect each other though a non-contact force.

Two electrically charged objects exert a non-contact force on each other when they are brought together. Opposite types of charged attract, and the same charges repel.
## Charging by Friction
Rubbing insulating materials against each other can result in them becoming electrically charged.

Electrons may be transferred from one material to the other, resulting in one material becoming negatively charged and other other positively charged.
### Example: Polythene Rod and Duster
When a polythene rod is rubbed with a duster, the friction causes the electrons to gain energy.

Once the electrons have gained enough energy, they can leave atoms on the duster and transfer to the polythene rod resulting in a negatively charged rod and positively charged duster

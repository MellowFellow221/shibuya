# Definitions
- *Energy* is a **property** of a system - a system has a certain amount of energy.
- The *law of conservation of energy* states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. That is, energy cannot appear out of nowhere and cannot disappear, instead it must go somewhere.
- An *open system* transfers energy and mass between it and its surroundings. Therefore, the total energy content of an open system may change.
- A *closed system* does not allow energy to be transferred to its surroundings. Hence, the total energy of a closed system remains constant.
- *Work* is a **process**, an event that changes the energy of the system. The concept of work is necessary to add or remove energy from a system.

> [!Note]
> Energy **(J)** is the ability to do work.
> Power: Rate of energy **(W)** transfer.
> W = J/s (Joules per second)

## Calculating Efficiency Questions
$\%efficiency = \frac{Euseful}{Einput}\cdot100$

| $E_{input}$ | $E_{output}$ | % $efficiency$ |
| ----------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| 1000        | 800          | 80%            |
| 1500        | 900          | 60%            |
|             | 600          | 75%            |
| 2000        | 1000         | 50%            |
| 1200        | 600          | 50%            |
|             | 300          | 25%            |
| 800         |              | 40%            |

## Energy Conversions
### Joules
Joules/1000 = Kilojoules

| Joules (J) | Kilojoules (kJ) |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| 5000       | 5               |
| 500        | 0.5             |
| 7500       | 7.5             |

### Watts
Milliwatt (mW)/1000 = Watt (W)/1000 = Kilowatt (kW)

| Milliwatts (mW) | Watts (W) | Kilowatts (kW) |
| --------------- | --------- | -------------- |
| 1,000,000       | 1000      | 1              |
| 500,000         | 500       | 0.5            |
| 2500            | 2.5       | 0.0025         |
| 3,000,000       | 3000      | 3              |

# Sankey Diagram
Consider a fluorescent light globe which produces 30 J of useful energy output for every 100 J of energy input, with the remainder lost as wasted output.

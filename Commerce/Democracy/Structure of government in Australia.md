# Role and Function of Political Parties
Political parties are groups of people who band together because they share the same views about issues they think are important. Their main aim is to get candidates elected to Parliament so as to influence the decisions of government.

All political parties must be registered with the Australian Electoral Commission. There are two requirements for this registration. First, the aims of the party must be submitted. Second, the party must have at least 500 eligible voters, unless the party already has a member in parliament.

Not all candidates belong to a political party. Some may be independents.
## Major Political Parties
- Australian Labour party
- Liberal Party of Australia
- National Party of Australia
- Greens Party
### Labour Party
The Australian Labour Party (ALP), the oldest political party in Australia, was formed in the 1890s=. Unemployment was then high and living conditions were harsh, so workers banded together. They wanted to try to change things by having a say in government. This background has meant that trade unions have always had strong links with the Labour Party.

The ALP's policies promote social justice, compassion and a fair go for all. Its main aims are to:
- ensure wealth and power are more evenly and fairly share in society
- provide jobs for everyone who wants to work
- abolish poverty and improve the living standards of all Australians
- ensure that all Australians can obtain the education, housing and community services they need.
In 2010, Labour Party leader Julia Hillard became the first female prime minister of Australia.

Oldest political party, first and only female prime minister. Grew from the labour and union movement in 1890s. Represents working people
### Liberal Party
The Liberal Party of Australia was founded by Robert Menzies in 1944. When in office, the Liberal Party usually forms a **coalition** with the National Party.
Liberal policies are based on the absolute rights and freedom of all people. The party believes in incentive, individual freedom and free enterprise. Its main aims are:
- a lean government that minimises interference in daily life and minimises taxes
- a government that encourages private businesses and does not compete with them
- a just and humane society in which the family and the role of law and justice are maintained

More conservative in modern day.
### National Party
The National Party was founded in 1914, originally as the Country Party. It mainly represents people living in rural and regional Australia. The Nationals fight for an equality of services, lifestyle and opportunity between the cities and the regions. Its main aims are to:
- provide strong local community representation
- ensure decent health, safety, social and economic welfare
- promote individual achievement. free choice, a fair go and reward for private enterprise

1920 formed to cover the rural areas. Teamed with the liberals to form the coalition. Focused on improving the lives of those living in the countryside, decreased taxes for rural workers, more investment in forestry.
### Greens Party
Formed in 1992, the Australian Greens (The Greens) is a progressive, national party founded on four main principles: ecological sustainability, social and economic justice, peace and nonviolence, and grassroots democracy. The Greens have frequently held the **balance of power** in the Senate. Its main aims are to:
- protect and preserve the environment
- ensure that everyone in our society is treated fairly and with respect
- create a safe, harmonious world in which force is not used to solve differences
- ensure that society is governed by the people, and not run by the wealthy and powerful.

Grew from the environmental protest movement in the 1980s, banded together in 1992 to create the party. No longer just environment, taxing greed and a range of other things. Once a party of protest to shake things up, now they are a more legitimate party.
### Independents
Members of parliament who do not belong to a political party are called **independents**. Their position can be very powerful if the government does not have a majority in parliament. It relies on these independents to support the Bills going through the parliament. The government often has to make compromises and deals with these independents to guarantee that government legislation passes.
# Questions

On Federation, 1 January 1901, the 6 Australian colonies joined together and become one nation. This made Australia an independent country but still had the British monarch as the head of state.

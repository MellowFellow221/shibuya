# The Australian Constitution
The Australian Constitution has properly been described as 'the birth certificate of a nation'. It also provides the basic rules for the government of Australia.

Indeed, the Constitution is the fundamental law of Australia binding everybody including the Commonwealth Parliament and the Parliament of each State. Accordingly, even an Act passed by a Parliament is invalid if it is contrary to the Constitution.
## What is a Democracy
In Australia, we live in a democracy. This means that our society is based around the idea that a government's power is derived from the **will of the people** and:
- Is exercised by them either **directly** or **indirectly**.
- Takes place through a system of representation-we elect individuals to represent us in parliament.
- Usually involves electing a member of a political party whose policies we agree with.

## What is Parliament?
The parliament of Australia brings together elected representatives from across the country, to make decisions about laws and to debate issues that are important to our nation. Parliament is also the place where government is formed and scrutinised.

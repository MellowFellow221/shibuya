# The Business Cycle

1. The **business cycle** refers to the recurring *pattern of economic growth and contraction* that an economy experiences over time.
2. The Australia economy does experience a cycle of **booms** and **busts**.
3. After a period of prosperity, business activity gradually slows until a **recession** or **depression** is reached.
4. Eventually, business picks up again until prosperity is restored.

## Phases of Business Cycle
### Boom
1. **Boom (Prosperity)** - The boom marks the height of the economic expansion.
2. It is the point at which the economy is operating at its highest level of output, employment, and income.
3. It typically means:
	1. High consumer spending -> businesses grow.
	2. Low unemployment -> more people have jobs.
	3. High confidence in the economy.
4. However, it also signals a potential shift towards the next phase.
### Contraction
1. In the **contraction** phase, economic activity slows down.
	1. Falling demand for goods and services.
	2. Businesses lose, leading to job losses.
	3. Lower incomes and spending -> the economy shrinks.
	4. Decline in production Consumer and business confidence may decrease, leading to reduced spending and investment.
2. A **recession** is a significant and prolonged contraction. (6 months of longer)
### Expansion
1. During this phase, the economy is growing, characterised by increasing economic activities:
	1. Government and businesses invest to stimulate growth.
	2. More jobs are created -> people start spending again.
	3. Economy expands back into prosperity.
	4. Higher production levels.
	5. Businesses are optimistic, and consumer spending tends to be strong.
### Depression
1. The depression is the *lowest point of the business cycle*.
2. It represents the end of the contraction phase and signals the beginning of a potential recovery.
3. A **severe and prolonged** recession can be referred to as a **depression**, although the term is less commonly used than "recession".
	1. Very high unemployment.
	2. Widespread business failures.
	3. confidence in the economy is very low.
- A **depression** is a severe and prolonged economic downturn, with high unemployment and a sharp deline in trade and production.
- The **2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC)** began when US homeowners *defaulted on mortgages, leading to the collapse of financial institutions*.
- The crisis quickly spread worldwide, causing stock markets to crash and global economic growth to decline.
- Unemployment surged, and some economies needed International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailouts to stay afloat.
- Governments responded with expansionary policies (e.g., lowering interest rates, increasing government spending) to encourage economic recovery.
## Business Cycle Fluctuations
1. The business cycle does **not** follow *a fixed pattern* - expansion can last months of years.
2. A contraction does not always lead to a recession or depression if recovery starts early.
3. Government actions, like the **Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)** lowing interest rates, can boost confidence and encourage spending to prevent a recession.
4. Economic downturns can be industry-specific (e.g., coal), but due to **interdependence**, changes in one sector can affect others.
5. **Growth can also spread** - higher demand for goods/services increases production, leading to higher incomes and further economic expansion.

# Circular Flow of the Economy
- While learning about the economy, an important concept to understand is the flow of money or finance that moves through the economy.
- The circular flow of income shows the connections between five key sectors in an economy and how money moves between them. It also highlights **injections** (money entering the economy) and **leakages** (money leaving the economy) which impacts economic activity.
## The Five-sector Circular Flow Model

### Consumer & Business Sector (1st & 2nd Sector)
- **Consumers (households)** provide **resources** (labour, land, capital) to businesses in exchange for income.
- **Businesses (firms)** use these resources to **produce goods and services**.
- Households then use their income to **purchase goods and services from businesses (consumption)**.
- This process creates an interdependent relationship between consumers and businesses.
### Financial Sector (3rd Sector)
- **Financial institutions** (e.g., banks) act as **intermediaries** between savers and borrowers.
- **Saving (S)** is when individuals or businesses store money in banks **(leakage – reduces spending in the economy)**.
- **Investment (I)** occurs when banks lend money to businesses to expand **(injection – increases economic activity)**.
### Government Sector (4th Sector)
- The **government sector** refers to local, state, and federal governments and has two significant roles in the circular flow of income:
- **Taxation (T)** is a **leakage**: The government collects money from individuals and businesses through income tax, company tax, and GST.
- **Government expenditure (G)** is an **injection**: The government spends money on infrastructure, education, healthcare, and welfare to stimulate economic activity.
### Overseas Sector (5th Sector)
- The **overseas sector refers to trade between Australia and other countries**. Trade consists of exports and imports.
- **Exports (X)** are **injections**: Goods/services sold overseas bring money into the economy.
- **Imports (M)** are **leakages**: Money leaves the economy when Australians buy overseas goods/services.
## Uses of the Circular Flow of Income
- The circular flow of income is used by economists to measure changes in the level of economic activity within an economy; that is, is the economy growing or shrinking?
- Economists compare **injections (I + G + X)** and **leakages (S + T + M)** to assess the economy:
- **Injections > Leakages → Economic Growth (More money circulating, economy expanding)**
- **Leakages > Injections → Economic Decline (Less money circulating, economy shrinking)**
- It is the government's role to try to manage and maintain a balance within their nation's economy by altering flows of money and influencing decisions within sectors.

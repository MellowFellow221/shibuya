# Situation Analysis (SWOT)
The business should examine the market situation and look at any factors that are in their control and those that they are not entirely in control of. A *SWOT Analysis* is often used by businesses to examine these factors outlining:
- **Strengths** - what the business does well
- **Weaknesses** - what the business needs to improve
- **Opportunities** - what is occurring outside the business that can improve the business' success Eg. new technologies, increase in international trade
- **Threats** - what can have a negative impact on the business that they have limited control over Eg. economic downturn, new competitors, new laws.

# Themes
## Introduction
Welcome to my house this is what the systems and topics covered in this networking systems and social computing project will be based off of. Starting off with the effects of disruptive technology.
## Introduction to Human-centric Computing
**Issues**
- **Investigate the effects of disruptive technology on everyday computing** 
Disruptive technology: Innovations that significantly alters industries, businesses, or consumers. It often introduces new markets or enters at the bottom of existing markets and eventually displaces established firms.

Disruptive technologies are innovations that significantly alter industries. Things so successful that they can create new markets or revolutionize existing ones. For instance Netflix, Netflix is a piece of disruptive technology as it completely changed the TV and movie industry. Rather than have to go out to the cinema or purchase physical media, using Netflix and their streaming service model you can access a massive library of movies. This essentially wiped out video rental stores as it was more convenient and cheaper to simply purchase a Netflix subscription and watch from home. No longer must you take time out of your day traveling to physical stores. Other disruptive technologies include YouTube and Spotify, all of these relatively new innovations allow anyone with an internet connection to access enormous libraries of content.

This has caused disruptive technology to embed itself in our everyday computing. With most media consumption now done through streaming services.
- **Investigate how the development of hardware and software has influenced the adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the Internet of Me (IoMe)** 
Internet of Things: A network of connected devices that collect and exchange data. These devices, equipped with sensors and connectivity, automate tasks, monitor processes, and provide insights.

Internet of Me: A personalized version of the Internet of Things that focuses on tailoring digital experiences and services to the individual user. Using the data collected by the IoT to create a highly customized and personalized digital ecosystem around each person.

Hardware and software are crucial to the adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the Internet of Me (IoMe) by enabling the connectivity, data processing, and personalization that these technologies rely on.

Thanks to advances in hardware like tiny sensors, low power processors and connectivity modules, IoT devices are everywhere. Places like your home might be filled with them, some IoT devices can even be worn. My watch for instance is filled with these tiny sensors to collect tons of data on my body. Ranging from the amount of steps I've taken to the quality of sleep I've been getting.

Software advances are also making it easier for these devices to communicate, analyse data, and make decisions in real time. Google Homes like the one in my home network use software in conjunction with their hardware capabilities to communicate and control devices within my network.

In summary, hardware advancements make it possible to embed smart capabilities in everyday objects, while software innovations enable these devices to process data, communicate, and provide personalized experiences. Together, hardware and software developments are driving the widespread adoption of IoT and IoMe, transforming how we interact with technology in our daily lives.
## Storage and Workflow in Enterprise Networks
**Issues** 
- **Investigate data storage requirements for an enterprise.** 
Data storage: The saving and storing digital information in a manner that allows it to be accessed and retrieved later.

Enterprises generate vast amounts of data every day—emails, customer information, financial records, and much more. All this data needs to be stored efficiently and securely. To meet these needs, enterprises have some options, on-premises storage for direct control and security or cloud storage for scalability and flexibility.

Here at Sonartech they have decided on on-premise storage for the speed and security benefits. This is as they must ensure their data is secure, with robust encryption, backups, and access controls to protect sensitive information.

Due to the huge amounts of data generated from sonars and the need to store software development tools, they have a very sizeable capacity. While they have the capacity to store up to 160 TB worth of data in these drive only 80 TB is usable space due to the RAID setup.

Storage requirements change depending on the business, some may require huge amounts of storage for tons of data ingestion and analysation while others will require much less only using it for document storage a business tools. Figuring out how much is needed should be done on a case by case basis by reviewing how much data is being generated.

- **Explore cloud computing services.**
Cloud computing can best be described as the use of a third parties computing services over the internet. There are three main deliveries of the services which each offer unique advantages and disadvantages.

Infrastructure-as-a-service delivers infrastructure resources to organizations over the internet. Customers don't have to manage, maintain, or update their own data center infrastructure, but are responsible for the operating system, middleware, virtual machines, and any apps or data. 

Platform-as-a-service delivers and manages all the hardware and software resources to develop applications through the cloud. This allows you to develop, run, and manage applications without having to build and maintain the infrastructure or platform on your own. 

Software-as-a-service: Provides the entire application stack, delivering an entire cloud-based application that customers can access and use. SaaS products are completely managed by the service provider and come ready to use, including all updates, bug fixes, and overall maintenance. 

Most consumers will only ever encounter software-as-a-service as it is the most simple and doesn't require maintenance. It's very likely parts of your workflow already depend on software-as-a-service. The services my household relies on come from the Google Suite, software such as Google Drive, Gmail, Google Photos and Google Maps each something that is crucial to my workflow and is too hard to set-up and manage on any personal hardware. Other cloud computing services that I use personally include Canvas, a learning management system and todoist a project management software.
## Network Architecture and Infrastructure
**Issues** 
- **Describe key components of an organisation's information technology infrastructure.** 
Organisations often have digital workflows and supporting these workflows are their information technology infrastructure, the base of their digital systems. Key components of this infrastructure includes things such as servers, storage and endpoint devices.

Servers are accessed through an organisations network and are normally used to provide data and services to other clients on the network. Servers can also be used as a powerful hub for computing rather than having each client do any computing themselves. The servers here are used to analyse data, process information and run large computations to further their research.

Storage is also key for an organisation so they are able to keep all resources and are able to keep all of their generated data. Often storage is added through network attached storage or a NAS which will then be used to store data organisations generate and resources they need for their work. Here they have multiple NAS's to ingest the roughly 500MB/s of data the sensors generate. This captured data can then be analysed and used for research.

Endpoint devices are the devices that users use to communicate across and access the organisations infrastructure. Things such as laptops or phones which connect into the network or use the server. These endpoint devices can be seen around the office which each employee uses to connect to the network and work on any projects.
- **Investigate security measures used to control access to networks.** 
Most networks have security measures in place to ensure only select users are able to connect. These measures include password systems, biometric measures and automatic updates.

Password systems require users to enter a password to gain access to the network or specific resources within the network. This has been widely adopted to stop unauthorised access to networks. My home network uses a lengthy unique password to ensure it isn't accessible by other people.

Biometric measures use a persons physical characteristics, such as fingerprints or facial recognition, to authenticate users and grant access to the network or specific resources. Biometric measures can be more secure than passwords since they are unique to each individual. Although this normally goes unused for networks, endpoint devices can use biometrics to authenticate users.

Automatic updates help protect against security vulnerabilities and exploits that could be used to gain unauthorised access to the network. ISP's normally roll out updates across all networks to ensure there are no bugs and possible speed lost from older software. I personally keep all the software on the home network updated to the newest releases to ensure we aren't missing out on any possible speed boosts or security.
## Creating a Network
**Issues** 
- **Explore opportunities for optimising network performance.** 
Network performance can be negatively impacted by multiple many different factors and positioning matters when you are trying to optimize network performance. To ensure the placement of your router isn't dampening speeds make sure to keep it central, in the open and higher up. Having your router in the middle of the house ensures you have the best coverage and aren't losing speed due to the signal degrading from traveling too far.

Keeping your router in the open will help with heat management, coverage and signal strength. It also means that the signal it puts out doesn't get degraded by traveling through things like heavy furniture or metal.

Having the router higher up might sound strange but performance can be increased by having the router on a shelf or just off the ground. This is as the signal can be damped by the ground.

Now your router is correctly positioned any extra speed can be gained from keeping the router up to date, upgrading your internet plan and upgrading the router.
- **Evaluate the role of hardware and software related to the transmission of data.** 
How is software and hardware related to data transmission?

Hardware and software allow for the transmission of data, for both unsecured data and encrypted data. They are the infrastructure that allows for transfer making the crucial for any data transfer.

Software is required for the encryption and decryption of data, without it you will be unable to use any encrypted data.  Software is also used as a tool to help locate and manage many different data transfers, it brings a ease of use to data transfers so anyone is able to easily receive and send  unsecured data or decrypt and encrypt data. 

Hardware like the network interface card make it possible to converse with other computers. Cables, routers and switches all bring the internet into your house and to your devices. They are used to establish and maintain network connections.

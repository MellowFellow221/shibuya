# Introduction
The internet. An advanced technology which has taken over most peoples daily lives in the developed world. It's a web which connects everything, from a client to a server, and between you and your family, who might be just down the road - or on the other side of the globe. It's a place where people build upon each other's ideas in new and creative ways, where circles of shared interests can flourish with people from all across the world who can share their experiences, and people from all different backgrounds can engage in constructive and meaningful discussions. It is a building block for many modern industries, and allows for access to the global market. People can share data and media across thousands of kilometres in mere minutes (depending on internet speed, latency and file size, of course) - which proves very useful for creators, and keep databases of thousands, even millions of customer records which can be access over the internet by any company branch. However, people are all too familiar with the consequences of our over-dependence on this technology.

That all sounds very grandiose, but what does the internet mean for *you*?

Lets explore, closer to home, shall we?

# Human-centric Computing
## Effect of Disruptive Technology on Everyday Computing

Disruptive technology is a technological innovation which completely alters the market. Since they have superior attributes and characteristics than their predecessors, they completely sweep them out of the market. A famous example of this is streaming services, such as Netflix, essentially wiping out the video rental store 'Block Buster' from the market - or more like the entire planet, with only one operating location, since it is cheaper and more convenient to purchase a Netflix subscription (which contains 17,000 titles) than rent one VHS tape. No longer did people have to take the time out of their day, and money out of their pockets, to rent one video tape. Now - from the comfort of their own home, for a much smaller fee, they have access to the whole video store, and more.

Disruptive technologies like these have upset people's daily lives countless times over the past century, and will continue to do so in the future.

To better visualise how disruptive technology has embedded itself in our daily lives and our everyday computing needs, we will be comparing my home network to how someone in the 1960's would perform the same tasks.

## Investigate how the Development of Hardware and Software Has Influenced the Adoption of IoT and IoMe (296)

The Internet of Things is a vast network of devices designed to make life easier, by performing pre-configured autonomous tasks, and communicate through the internet. They have sensors, connect-ability and can be configured from a central location.

While the IoT is a vast network between devices, the IoMe (internet of me)'s purpose is to create an enjoyable and personalised user experience based on data they collect on you. Whether that be manually setting preferences, to music habits, and even personalised advertising based on browsing history.

This would not have been possible without the development of different software, protocols and hardware.
Different hardware developments include:
- Power efficiency in smaller sensors
- Smaller batteries with greater capacity
- Mass production for cheaper
While, for the IoMe
- Much greater computing power (enterprise CPU's, RAM, data centres)
- Developments in algorithms and AI to allow for greater data analysis (software)
- Software protocols (HTTP, TCP, UDP) allowing for greater connectivity

As for the IoT at our home network, we have ring devices placed around our house. From our mobile devices, we can configure the devices and access their live video feeds. They use our internet connection to communicate via the ring servers. Using sensors, when they detect motion they send an alert through the internet to notify us that there is someone at the door.

For the IoMe, services such as Spotify aim to provide a personalized experience by formulating new music choices based on your previous listening history by comparing your data to millions of records which also have similar characteristics. Thanks to the power of IoT and the Google Cast protocol, music can be cast from a mobile device to a Google Nest device. A new feature which streamlines this into a feature is AI DJ.

## Investigate Data Storage Requirements for an ~~enterprise~~. (238) ※BUSINESS※

Data storage requirements are significant components that allow for the secure storage of data, compliance with regulations and to ensure operations remain undisrupted. To keep the business running smoothy, we had to carefully assess our data storage requirements, taking into account the needs of capacity, accessibility, device location and security.

*Capacity and Location*

Capacity is the amount of data which can be stored. For operations, it's best that our storage capacity solution is highly scalable, while location is where that data is stored, whether locally or on the cloud.

For our **plumbing business** network, in which we do administration and accounting at home, we utilize both data storage on laptops and the cloud, provided by MYOB - which is where our 'company file' is stored, with all of the customer records and invoices. For redundancy, it's stored in paper form too. It is around 500MB in size. Other data, like emailed business plans, is stored in the highly-scalable Business Google Cloud.

*Accessibility and Security*

Accessibility is where the data can be access from, ease of access and speed of data retrieval, and security is the measures set in place to prevent unauthorized access.

We employ a hybrid solution, in which sensitive data (such as consumer information) is stored locally and on our private cloud, while invoices and plans are stored on the public cloud. This ensures that our customer information is kept safe, while utilizing our available capacity. For physical security, our house remains locked with a security system, in addition to the aforementioned ring doorbells.

All of our devices are password protected, some with biometrics, to prevent unauthorized access into our devices.

The data can be accessed from anywhere there is an internet connection, however an email, password and Two-Factor Authentication is required.
- [ 2FA is where a code is sent to another device owned by the account owner to reduce the risk of unauthorized access. ]

## Explore Cloud Computing Services (190)

There are three main types of cloud computing services, which offer a variety of tools over the internet.
Essentially, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—such as servers, storage capacity, databases, networking, software, and intelligence—over the Internet, or "the cloud".
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS):- Offsite virtualized computing resources which offer a cheaper and more scalable approach than upgrading existing hardware.
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS):- Mostly utilised by developers, it is a platform which allows for the development, testing and deployment of applications.
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS):- Software applications on the web, usually utilising the subscription model. It allows for greater collaboration and ease of use without the complexity of installation and network developments.

In my home network, we utilise many types of SaaS applications to perform a variety of tasks.

**Canvas and Google Suite/Classroom, and CSU Interact2**
- As a student-heavy house, we utilise a variety of classroom management web apps. They allow students to work on assignments together in real time, submission and receiving feedback all over the internet - through only a web browser.

**Teams and Zoom**
- Video conferencing allow for effective discussions remotely. We use them to discuss logistics for Scouting activities, hold regular meetings with colleagues and for remote monitoring through Lifeline volunteer work.

**Google Suite**
- The google suite is a professional office suite all accessed through the internet - no installation required. It allows for accessible and real-time collaboration.
Since we are not developers, and have all the computing power we need at home, we do not utilise PaaS and IaaS.
## Describe how Transmission Media is Used in Networks. (243)

Transmission media is the physical medium in which data packets are sent to and throughout a network. Transmission media is split into two categories;

| Guided (Wired)                                           | Unguided (Wireless) |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Twisted-pair cable (Ethernet)                            | Radio/Microwaves    |
| Coaxial Cable (Copper - used in broadcast and broadband) | Infrared            |

To connect our home network to the wider internet, in our neighbourhood the NBN have utilised HFC (Hybrid Fibre Coaxial) cables.

[ PHOTOSENSITIVITY WARNING! ]

Fibre-Optic cables connect the headend/distribution centre to a node in the neighbourhood. Fibre-Optic cables are used since they are impenetrable to interference and use pulses of light …(pause, show flashing light) to allow for extremely fast data transfer speeds over large distances. The NBN then utilised previously existing TV (Coaxial) cables … (pause, show to bring internet to homes.

Within our network, we mainly utilize WIFI on the 2.4/5GHz bands to connect our various endpoint devices (laptops, mobile phones, chromecasts) to the internet. WiFi uses omnidirectional radio waves to broadcast a signal, which can be connected to by any device within its range.

However, since Wi-Fi is subject to interference and is less reliable, for heavy-duty internet tasks (such as servers), Category 6 Ethernet cables are used. This is due to the lower latency (measures the delay it takes for a packet to arrive at it's destination) and reliability provided by Ethernet cables.

In summary, HFC connects our network to the internet, and within the network we use both Ethernet and Radio waves.

## Explain Factors that Interfere with the Transmission of Data across a Computer and Social Network. (237)
There are four main factors which cause interference within the transmission of data.
{
- Topography
- Distance
- Physical Barriers
- Environmental Barriers.
}
### Topography
Topography is the layout of physical features within an area. While there is no significant impact, our Ethernet cable between the server and router must be routed underground and weaved through pillars, causing more cabling to be used than if it was kept above ground, slightly impacting latency.

### Distance
Our Wi-Fi is dual banded between the 2.4GHz and 5GHz radio frequency bands. While 5GHz is stronger, it has less range due to the size of the waves themselves. Our network will automatically pick a band based on factors like device compatibility, signal strength, and distance. However, since our residence is not large, thus adequate speed and latency is achieved throughout.

### Physical Barriers
Our Wi-Fi must travel through hollow walls made of plasterboard and wooden stubs. However, at any point in the house, radio waves only need to travel through a maximum of three walls, not significantly impacting speed and latency. However, at the perimeters, signal strength drops significantly (such as outside), most likely as a combination of distance and our red-brick walls.

### Environmental Barriers
Environmental factors have caused significant damage to our transmission mediums. A lightning strike caused various IoT devices and our WiFi system to short-circuit. In addition, our microwave can cause some interference with the 2.4GHz band, however this is subverted by our 5GHz band Wi-Fi.

## Design and Model a Network of Interconnected Devices for a Specific Purpose. (201)
Our ad-hoc network is designed to suit our schooling, home life and business needs, which includes some smart devices.
We run on an NBN-50 plan with Telstra Smart Modem Gen 2 to allow for backup 4G internet in the case of an internet outage. The NBN50 plan suits our needs as our activities don't require very fast speeds. We configure security measures, such as adjusting the firewall and changing the default admin password.
- Most devices are connected through Wi-Fi.
We are very Google-centred, thus have almost a Google device in each room to allow us to send messages, ask general questions (such as the weather) and cast media to our televisions.
To ensure our home is safe, as mentioned before, we have a network of ring devices around the perimeter of our house, connected through the internet and Ring's servers.
All of these devices are configured from mobile phones, which are linked to our Google and Ring account.
In addition, all of our laptops and gaming consoles are connected through Wi-Fi.
- As mentioned previously, our server's capabilities will suffer from the latency issues that come with Wi-Fi, so instead connects via an Ethernet Cable directly to the switch on the modem.
We have created this easily accessible and simple network to suit our needs as students, as a family and as workers.
## Explore Opportunities for Optimizing Network Performance
There are a multitude of ways to increase network speed, improve latency and allow for a greater signal coverage - all which contribute to network performance. There are things on both the end-point device side and router side which can be done to improve performance.

### Drivers and Firmware
On our end-point devices, keeping drivers, especially network drivers, up to date is essential in optimizing network performance in end-point devices. Updates in driver code can fix bugs and increase performance, which allows for the optimization of data transfer between the hardware (Network Adapters/Interface Cards) and software (OS) layers.

In addition, updating firmware, which is software embedded into hardware to control their operation, is crucial in optimizing performance. On our router, firmware is updated automatically. Firmware and drivers improve;
- Stability and Reliability (greater uptime and consistent performance)
- Signal strength and coverage (maximizing range and stability at a distance)
- Performance Enhancements (resolving slow speed issues, fixing performance bugs)
### Plans
When a router/modem is purchased from the Internet Service Provider, a plan is chosen to suit your needs, as some professions (such as online influencers) require great amounts of internet speeds. Some examples of speed tiers include;
- NBN50 (50Mbps / 20 Mbps)
- NB250 (250Mbps / 25Mbps)
- NBN1000 (1000Mbps / 50Mbps)
which directly impacts network performance.

Knowing the right plan for my home network, along with keeping drivers and firmware up to date will ensure our network performance is optimized to its fullest capability.

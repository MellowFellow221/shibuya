# Subject Selection

## Year 10
Entering year 10 I hope to swap out Enterprise computing and re-weigh all potential options so I can further align my current life with the future I hope to be in.

| Subject              | Status  | Most to least preferred                                |
| -------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Enterprise computing | Removal | Information Software & Technology (Computing Studies) |
|                      |         | Food Technology                                       |
|                      |         | Graphics Technology                                   |
|                      |         | Design & Technology                                   |
|                      |         | Business Studies (Preliminary)                        |
|                      |         | Textiles Technology                                   |
|                      |         | Industrial Technology Metal                           |

Weighing this is hard as I have heard differing opinions about the courses offered.
- **Information Software & Technology (Computing Studies)** - has little to do with actual computing studies. Most of their course is currently excel sheets and book work, assessment task was a excel sheet on data surrounding an issue and a report on the potential solutions. Even Jarrod is thinking of dropping it.
- **Graphics Technology** - Eric doesn't enjoy it. Most work includes planning and drawing things.
- **Design & Technology** - Unsure what this course is.
- **Industrial Technology Metal** - Don't want to take 2 industrial technology courses.
- **Food Technology** - Waste of a subject. Also likely too full.
- **Textiles Technology** - I'm not a girl. Also lack of drawing and creative skills. Would likely find it hard to design and create and sort of clothing.
- **Business Studies (Preliminary)** - Unsure if this is still open but it would also mean I am taking 2 commerce and money courses.

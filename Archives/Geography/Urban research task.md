# Bangalore, India

Bangalore, officially known as Bengaluru, is the capital of Karnataka, located in southern India. Located at latitude 12.9716° N and longitude 77.5946° E, the city covers an area of 741 km² with a population over 14 million, giving it a population density of approximately 11,000/km2. By population it is the third-largest city in India after Mumbai and Delhi. Over the past few decades, Bangalore has transformed into the "Silicon Valley of India" due to its booming IT industry and creating 38% of India's IT exports. This rapid growth has attracted people from across the country, leading to an unprecedented rise in the population and a host of urban challenges.

As seen in the population pyramid, the city's demographics are slightly skewed towards males, with 10% more males than females, and the median age of the population stands at 28 years. India remains 36% urbanized, reflecting its status as a developing country

## Factors Influencing the Growth in the City

Urbanization is the process defined as the increasing concentration of people in urban areas as they relocate from rural regions. This shift results in the growth and expansion of cities and towns. Bangalore has demonstrated this trend, once known for its lush gardens and pleasant climate, the city has evolved into a major global IT hub, often referred to as the "Silicon Valley of India". The establishment of IT parks and multinational companies has driven economic growth and pushed jobseekers from around the country into the city for economic possibilities.

However, this rapid urbanization has produced both positive and negative effects. Positively, it has boosted Bangalore's economy. The city alone creates 38% of India's IT exports, and its job market has expanded exponentially. Negatively, infrastructure planning has lagged behind this explosive growth, leading to issues such as traffic congestion, environmental degradation, and water scarcity. This makes the city suitable for funding as it requires help cleaning their water sources and local environments, much like what has happened recently in Paris with the Seine, which had large amounts of the waste removed and water cleaned. ![A map of water supply

## Water Scarcity due to Urbanization

Bangalore's water scarcity is one of the most pressing challenges linked to its urbanization. At an altitude of 924 meters above sea level, the city receives limited rainfall, making water a naturally scarce resource. Historically, the city relied on over 400 lakes to meet its water needs. However, government data indicates a steady decline, with the number of lakes reducing to 260 by the 1940s due to unplanned and irresponsible urbanization. Uncontrolled developmental activities around lakes caused severe damage to both surface and groundwater resources. The construction of buildings and infrastructure in lake catchment areas resulted in pollution from solid waste and construction debris, which clogged stormwater drains and further degraded water bodies. As a result, the number of lakes in the city has plummeted to just 65. This resulted in Bangalore relying on wells to pump groundwater, but now all groundwater units in Bangalore are over-exploited, extracting significantly more water than is being recharged.

*This map shows the change in ground water levels between 2022 and 2023.*

More than 90% of Bangalore's lakes are now polluted or encroached upon. 90% of lakes are fed by untreated sewage and industrial wastewater, leading to severe contamination. Additionally, solid waste and construction debris are regularly dumped into these water bodies, exacerbating the pollution. A water quality analysis of 80 lakes revealed that half of them are highly polluted. Additionally, out of the 14,000 government borewells in the city 6,900 have dried up. This widespread pollution and encroachment of lakes can be visualized in the map below.

The negative impacts of water pollution are becoming more and more relevant to the Bangaloreans due to a shortage of 330 ML of water per day. This water shortage has affected more than 7000 villages, 1100 wards, and 220 administrative districts thus far. Even some schools were temporarily shut down due to shortage of water and some hospitals were grappling with acute scarcity of water leading to significant healthcare obstacles.

### Response to the Issue

In response to the issue of water scarcity the Karnataka government has implemented various initiatives. Such as the Jal Jeevan Mission Karnataka (JJM) "JJM has been implemented with a larger objective of providing safe drinking water to all households in Rural India by 2024 … In addition to maintaining sustainability of water sources, grey water management, water conservation, rainwater harvesting & rejuvenation, and recharging of water bodies are also part of the mission.". This is done using schemes like the single village scheme, where a small tank installed with 3-4 taps is filled with water with the help of an electric pump from the well, to facilitate drinking water for the rural population. They also have the Water Quality Monitoring and Surveillance Program which is predominantly focusing on supplying clean and safe drinking water to Rural Karnataka. Ensuring drinking water to rural areas will be supplied only after the water quality is assured.

The program has helped rural areas by improving the quality of life of the rural population by providing clean drinking water but has not solved the overall issue of pollution and overuse of water basins. This is showcased in most of the images above, as treated water supply is still low in more rural areas, the number of bodies of water decreasing each year, and a significant decrease in the ground water levels. In addition, the lake map showcases how many lakes continue to become polluted or encroached upon. In conclusion, the initiatives in place are not currently enough to keep up with the water scarcity issue for much of the population.

# Environmental Worldviews

1. Why should we care about the environment?
It provides us resources and conditions that are necessary for life.
2. Are we the most important beings on the planet or are we just one of the earth's millions of different life forms?
Both, we are the most important beings on the planet due to having the largest impact on the planet by magnitudes but also we are just one of the many life forms and are on a larger scale equally important as every other living thing.
3. Do we have an obligation to see that our activities do not cause the extinction of other species? Should we try to protect all species or only some? How do we decide which ones to protect?
We do have an obligation to protect all species, to protect earth and even just to ensure humanity can continue to survive. Without large amounts of diverse species many environments would likely not survive. Which loops back into the first question.
4. Do we have an ethical obligation to pass the natural world onto future generations in at least as good a condition as we inherited?
Yes, to ensure the human species is able to continue as well as the planet that we live on. If quality degrades over each inheritance earth will quickly no longer be able to support the necessary cycles to support humanity.
5. Should every person be entitled to equal protection from environmental hazards regardless of race, gender, age, national origin, income, social class, or any other factor?
Yes, I don't see why we wouldn't do that.
6. How do we promote sustainability.
Propaganda.
7. Why is it important for individuals to consider their own worldviews.
To better understand what they want for the world and how they align with different policies and other people.
8. Explain why some nations are reluctant to reduce their emissions.
Money, moving away from emissions can cost money and companies are able to use their power to persuade politicians to let them continue making money.
9. Answer the following questions to build your own ecological identity.
	1. Where do all the things I use and depend on come from?
	The environment and China.
	2. Where do all my waste products go?
	The environment and China.
	3. What do I know about the environment I live in?
	It's quite clean.
	4. How am I connected to the natural world and other living organisms?
	I exist.
	5. What is my purpose in life?
	Have sex, make kids.
	6. What is my responsibility as a human living on this planet?
	Take care of the environment and as listed above.
10. Which of the worldviews in the table above fits mostly with your thoughts?
Earth centred.

# Public Space Crisis
[Are we in the midst of a public space crisis - The conversation](https://theconversation.com/are-we-in-the-midst-of-a-public-space-crisis-56124)
## Comprehension Questions

1. *How does the article describe the impact of budget cuts and private funding on the availability and design of public spaces in modern cities? Provide specific examples mentioned in the text.*
The article describes budget cuts as crippling the government's ability to invest in public spaces.
	"Budget cuts and have crippled the government's ability to invest in public spaces, such as parks, for poor neighbourhoods."
This reduces the overall amounts of public areas and private funding ensures the spaces being built are serving the wealthy's interests and needs.
	"Wealthy philanthropists who often fund or contribute to public projects like the High Line will often end up simply serving their own interests and needs by investing in convenient areas that are close to their homes and offices."
When combined it ensure public spaces are only available to the wealthy. With poorer areas not having the funding to create and up keep the spaces and poorer people not being able to reach the wealthy parks due to being so far out the area. The design of public spaces is also changed as private funding more often goes to specific types of facilities which are less amendable to large groups or physical activity. Public spaces are also designed that restrict "undesirables" – like the homeless – from getting too comfortable, as mentioned in the text.
	"These include the use of arms on benches to prevent people from lying down and the addition of spikes on flat surfaces."
2. *What are some of the limitations of social media as a platform for democratic engagement according to the article? How does the author suggest combining the strengths of digital and physical public spaces?*
A limitation of social media as a platform for democratic engagement is that it doesn't last long or pull through in the real world. Social media works as a very loud voice and a great kick off, but often falls off quickly and doesn't effect actual change.
	"Social media can initially act as a powerful voice, but does a poor job keeping momentum and effecting actual change."
In addition changes social media can promote will have an inherent bias as it is still not sufficiently accessible to scores of underprivileged people.
## Reflection Questions

1. *Reflect on the challenges faced by low-income and minority communities regarding access to public spaces as highlighted in the article. How can urban planners and policymakers address these disparities to ensure more equitable access?*
Low-income and minority communities have lower access to public spaces due to them being far out of their area. Urban planners can create plans for poorer areas or move existing plans to areas with less public spaces. Policymakers can also increase funding for public spaces in low-income areas. The increased funding for public spaces in low-income areas can reduce the impact of private funding on decisions in the area.

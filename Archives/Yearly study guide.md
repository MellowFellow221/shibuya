## Revision Study Guide
### Topic 1 : Consumer and Financial Decisions
1. **Define Consumer Rights.**
Consumers have the rights to expect certain things when they buy a product or service.
2. **Describe below at least one example/scenario of how each of the above rights may be breached by a retailer/wholesaler/manufacturer. THINK - The Checkout Clip.**
Buying a product and having it be lower quality or broken compared to the one you were offered/shown. If you went to a retail store and bought a bowl in a box after holding a high quality purple one and being sold on it. Then going home to find the bowl you bought was made out of plastic and uncoloured. This breaches consumer rights as the consumer expects it to be purple and high quality.
3. **Explain the difference between a credit card and direct debit.**
Debit cards are linked to the users bank account and limited to how much money is in the account. Credit cards provide users with a line of credit they can borrow against as they need and pay back later.
The difference between the cards are weather you are spending money directly from your bank account and are limited to the amount in there, direct debit, or you are borrowing against a line of credit to borrow against, credit card.
4. **What three essential elements make a legally binding contract?**

Romance scams are scams where someone online pretends to be someone else or in love with the victim and repeatedly ask for money, deceiving the victim as they believe the are in love and the money is needed for certain things. The features include repeated request for money and attempt to emotionally manipulate you.
Investment scams are scams where individuals trick others into investing money under false pretences, resulting in financial loss. Features include having certainty things will happen in a certain way with investments and extremely high returns.
7. **Which scam/rip-off do you feel impacts consumers the most financially? Justify your answer.**
Investment scams impact consumers the most financially. As reported by the ACCC this is the scam that has caused the highest amount of money has been lost by Australians. I believe this as most consumers that fall for the scam believe that investing large sums of money will certainly return more. So by simply investing as much as possible they will maximise the profit they turn causing them to lose significantly more.

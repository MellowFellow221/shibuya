# Simple Interest
Simple interest: $I = Prn$
$I$ = interest, the amount earned.
$P$ = principle value, the starting balance.
$r$ = rate, the interest rate as a decimal.
$n$ = time in years.
## Derivation
By rearranging the original formula we can derive other variables.
- Find the **Interest** when we know the Principle Value, the Interest Rate and number of Years.
$$I = Prn$$
- Find the **Principle Value** when we know the Interest, the Interest Rate and number of Years.
$$P = \frac{I}{rn}$$
- Find the **Interest Rate** when we know the Principle Value, Interest and number of Years.
$$r=\frac{I}{Pn}$$
- Find the number of **Years** when we know the Principle Value, Interest and Interest Rate
$$n=\frac{I}{Pr}$$

# Rise of the Nazi Party
## Weaknesses in the Weimar Republic
The democratic nature of the Weimar Constitution (too many parties) made governing impossible. Due to there being no majority in the government they were too indecisive falling behind running the country, making them unstable.
## Impact of the Great Depression
By the 1930s, millions of Germans were unemployed. Throughout this time, the Weimar government became less & less democratic, making huge cuts made to public spending.
## Performance of the Nazis in Elections
The Nazis were not always popular, but support grew substantially from 1930 due to effective propaganda, the development of an active movement, and a strong leader.

Violence became a common aspect of politics after WW1. The *Sturmabteilung*, aka the SA, Storm Troopers or Brownshirts, were established to 'protect' Nazi leaders, but were also used to demonstrate Hitler's ability to maintain order & discipline.

President Paul von Hindenburg and other high-ranking politicians decided to appoint Hitler as Chancellor in 1933, hoping to use him as a puppet.

Promising radical change the Nazi's were able to take advantage of these weaknesses and instability allowing the Nazi party to rise faster than they would have otherwise been able to. These weaknesses in the Weimar republic created the want or even need for a new governing system which helped the Nazi's rise as they promised to be this new radical overhaul to the government.

Another major factor that allowed the Nazi party to come into power was their performance in elections. Through their use of propaganda and masterfully crafted speeches they were able to gain large numbers of supporters and votes quickly.

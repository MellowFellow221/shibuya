# Vietnam War Essay
Your essay question:
- Using at least one source from the source booklet and your own knowledge, assess the reasons why people came to oppose the Vietnam War.
Assess - Make a judgement of value, quality, outcome, results or size.
## Possible Reasons
- Moral and ethical concerns
- Anti-imperialism
- Human costs
- Conscription
- Government distrust
- Influence of the civil rights movement
- International solidarity
### Moral and ethical concerns
Many civilians thought any involvement in Vietnam was fundamentally wrong, particularly given the significant impact on civilian populations. The use of tactics like bombings and chemical warfare (e.g., Agent Orange) raised serious ethical questions about the conduct of the war. Activists argued that the war was causing unnecessary suffering and destruction, and this moral outrage spurred widespread protests.
### Anti-imperialism
The Vietnam war was seen by many as an example of American imperialism, where the U.S. was intervening in Vietnam to exert its influence rather than to support genuine self-determination. It was seen as an attempt to stop the spread of communism and maintain U.S. hegemony in Southeast Asia, often disregarding the desires and rights of the Vietnamese people.
### Human costs
The staggering loss of life was a significant factor in the anti-war sentiment. Estimates suggest that as many as 2,000,000 civilians on both sides and some 1,100,000 North Vietnamese and Viet Cong fighters, along with over 58,000 American soldiers. Graphic images and reports of violence and destruction form the front lines, especially through television and print media, played a crucial role in shaping public perception and increasing opposition to the war.
### Conscription
The military draft, instituted in the early years of the war, forced many young men to serve, leading to widespread resentment. The draft was seen as inequitable, as it disproportionately affected lower-income individuals who could not afford college deferments. This unfairness galvanised opposition, particularly among college students and civil rights activists, leading to protests and demonstrations.
### Government distrust (US)
As the war progressed, many Americans became increasingly distrustful of their government. The publication of the Pentagon Papers in 1971 revealed that the government had misled the public about the reasons for the war and its progression. This breach of trust fuelled anti-war sentiment, as people felt betrayed by leaders who had escalated the conflict without transparency.
### Civil rights movement (US and AUS)
The civil rights movement of the 1960s emphasised social justice and equality, leading many activists to draw parallels between domestic struggles and the war in Vietnam. Prominent figures, including Martin Luther King Jr., spoke out against the war, arguing that it diverted resources from social programs aimed at fighting poverty and inequality at home. This connection helped unify various social movements against the war.
### International solidarity
The Vietnam war was viewed as part of a larger struggle against colonialism and imperialism. Many activists in the U.S. and around the world expressed solidarity with the Vietnamese people, seeing their fight as emblematic of oppressed peoples seeking self-determination. This global perspective fostered an international anti-war movement, with protests and demonstrations occurring in countries around the world.

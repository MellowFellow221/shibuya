# Vietnam War Essay
Your essay question:
- Using at least one source from the source booklet and your own knowledge, assess the reasons why people came to oppose the Vietnam War.
Assess - Make a judgement of value, quality, outcome, results or size.
## Possible Reasons
- Moral and ethical concerns
- Anti-imperialism
- Human costs
- Conscription
- Government distrust
- Influence of the civil rights movement
- International solidarity
### Moral and Ethical Concerns
Many civilians thought any involvement in Vietnam was fundamentally wrong, particularly given the significant impact on civilian populations. The use of tactics like bombings and chemical warfare (e.g., Agent Orange) raised serious ethical questions about the conduct of the war. Activists argued that the war was causing unnecessary suffering and destruction, and this moral outrage spurred widespread protests.
### Anti-imperialism
The Vietnam war was seen by many as an example of American imperialism, where the U.S. was intervening in Vietnam to exert its influence rather than to support genuine self-determination. It was seen as an attempt to stop the spread of communism and maintain U.S. hegemony in Southeast Asia, often disregarding the desires and rights of the Vietnamese people.
### Human Costs
The staggering loss of life was a significant factor in the anti-war sentiment. Estimates suggest that as many as 2,000,000 civilians on both sides and some 1,100,000 North Vietnamese and Viet Cong fighters, along with over 58,000 American soldiers. Graphic images and reports of violence and destruction form the front lines, especially through television and print media, played a crucial role in shaping public perception and increasing opposition to the war.
### Conscription
The military draft, instituted in the early years of the war, forced many young men to serve, leading to widespread resentment. The draft was seen as inequitable, as it disproportionately affected lower-income individuals who could not afford college deferments. This unfairness galvanised opposition, particularly among college students and civil rights activists, leading to protests and demonstrations.
### Government Distrust (US)
As the war progressed, many Americans became increasingly distrustful of their government. The publication of the Pentagon Papers in 1971 revealed that the government had misled the public about the reasons for the war and its progression. This breach of trust fuelled anti-war sentiment, as people felt betrayed by leaders who had escalated the conflict without transparency.
### Civil Rights Movement (US and AUS)
The civil rights movement of the 1960s emphasised social justice and equality, leading many activists to draw parallels between domestic struggles and the war in Vietnam. Prominent figures, including Martin Luther King Jr., spoke out against the war, arguing that it diverted resources from social programs aimed at fighting poverty and inequality at home. This connection helped unify various social movements against the war.
### International Solidarity
The Vietnam war was viewed as part of a larger struggle against colonialism and imperialism. Many activists in the U.S. and around the world expressed solidarity with the Vietnamese people, seeing their fight as emblematic of oppressed peoples seeking self-determination. This global perspective fostered an international anti-war movement, with protests and demonstrations occurring in countries around the world.

History Draft

Public opposition to Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War stemmed from several key factors, most notably conscription and the graphic exposure of the war's brutality through uncensored media coverage. As the first war to be broadcast directly into people's homes, it revealed the horrific realities of combat, undermining public support. Simultaneously, the introduction of conscription, particularly its perceived unfairness and the immorality of forcing individuals to war, provoked widespread protests from the public to protect not just individuals, but society as a whole. Together, these factors played a central role in shaping the general public's growing disapproval of the war.

Focus on the variety of groups of people against conscription for a variety of reasons rather than limiting yourself to ONLY the save our sons stuff.

Additionally, the war being fully uncensored unveiled the horrific nature of war to the average civilian, being another profound reason in the public's disapproval of the engagements within Vietnam. The unrestricted footage and media made some question the morality of this brutal conflict and why their country was even involved at all. The ideas surrounding the reasons of the Australian involvement in Vietnam, such as the idea of containment and the Domino Theory didn't feel personal, and didn't justify sacrificing soldiers thousands of kilometers away from their home soil. <source about protest>. Furthermore, the valor and glory traditionally associated with war were stripped away by these confronting images, which exposed the true and brutal reality of combat. Instead of being celebrated as heroes, soldiers were increasingly criticized by the public, who began to focus more on the violence of their actions than on their role as fighters. <source about either brutality or criticising soldiers>. This growing immorality further condemned the war and even manipulated fighters in questioning if they were in the right. Therefore showing the impact the new media censorship had on shaping, and fueling the public's protest against Australia's involvement in the Vietnam war.

One of the major reasons for opposition to the Vietnam conflict was conscription, driven not only by general hatred toward it, but also by a sense of unfairness and the belief that Australians were being forced to fight someone else's war, which remained immoral in many people's hearts. Conscription was a system introduced to draft capable bodied men into war by force, often by ballots containing birthdays. Many opposed this idea, some claiming it to be unfair and unrighteous, forcing people into a war they did not want to fight. Parents of sons were shattered knowing their beloved ones were being sent to the frontlines without any way of fighting back. <source about protest or sad parents> The public felt powerless against the decisions made. Although it was capable of acquiring an exemption, it was increasingly difficult, with specific categories and circumstances more accessible to the wealthy, such as university students, adding to the unfairness of conscription. A significant portion of the drafted even went as far as harming themselves to exempt themselves from military service. Furthermore, Australians questioned the legitimacy of forcing troops overseas to fight in what they saw as a foreign conflict unrelated to national defense, adding on to the growing disapproval of conscription and the Vietnam conflict as a whole. The public believed this conflict mainly served the interests of other superpowers such as the USA, rather than protecting their own borders. As a result, the war began to seem meaningless, unworth conscripting men to fight in. This sense of detachment from the cause intensified public frustration, especially as young men were expected to risk their lives for a war that had no clear justification at home. As this mentality spread, it added to the growing disapproval of conscription and the Vietnam conflict. Ultimately, due to the many different reasons, blooming negative reactions towards conscription, such as the unfairness and immorality of dying in someone else's war played a huge role in the public's shift in perspective towards the Vietnam war.

Again good, but just quickly you might want to reference a historical violent image or smth as example of what people were exposed to. Not necessary but could strengthen your argument, just mention it briefly or smth if you do. Could put it after the unrestricted footage and media

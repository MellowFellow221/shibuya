# Vietnam War Essay
Your essay question:
- Using at least one source from the source booklet and your own knowledge, assess the reasons why people came to oppose the Vietnam War.
Assess - Make a judgement of value, quality, outcome, results or size.
## Possible Reasons
- Moral and ethical concerns
- Anti-imperialism
- Human costs
- Conscription
- Government distrust
- Influence of the civil rights movement
- International solidarity
### Moral and Ethical Concerns
Many civilians thought any involvement in Vietnam was fundamentally wrong, particularly given the significant impact on civilian populations. The use of tactics like bombings and chemical warfare (e.g., Agent Orange) raised serious ethical questions about the conduct of the war. Activists argued that the war was causing unnecessary suffering and destruction, and this moral outrage spurred widespread protests.
### Anti-imperialism
The Vietnam war was seen by many as an example of American imperialism, where the U.S. was intervening in Vietnam to exert its influence rather than to support genuine self-determination. It was seen as an attempt to stop the spread of communism and maintain U.S. hegemony in Southeast Asia, often disregarding the desires and rights of the Vietnamese people.
### Human Costs
The staggering loss of life was a significant factor in the anti-war sentiment. Estimates suggest that as many as 2,000,000 civilians on both sides and some 1,100,000 North Vietnamese and Viet Cong fighters, along with over 58,000 American soldiers. Graphic images and reports of violence and destruction form the front lines, especially through television and print media, played a crucial role in shaping public perception and increasing opposition to the war.
### Conscription
The military draft, instituted in the early years of the war, forced many young men to serve, leading to widespread resentment. The draft was seen as inequitable, as it disproportionately affected lower-income individuals who could not afford college deferments. This unfairness galvanised opposition, particularly among college students and civil rights activists, leading to protests and demonstrations.
### Government Distrust (US)
As the war progressed, many Americans became increasingly distrustful of their government. The publication of the Pentagon Papers in 1971 revealed that the government had misled the public about the reasons for the war and its progression. This breach of trust fuelled anti-war sentiment, as people felt betrayed by leaders who had escalated the conflict without transparency.
### Civil Rights Movement (US and AUS)
The civil rights movement of the 1960s emphasised social justice and equality, leading many activists to draw parallels between domestic struggles and the war in Vietnam. Prominent figures, including Martin Luther King Jr., spoke out against the war, arguing that it diverted resources from social programs aimed at fighting poverty and inequality at home. This connection helped unify various social movements against the war.
### International Solidarity
The Vietnam war was viewed as part of a larger struggle against colonialism and imperialism. Many activists in the U.S. and around the world expressed solidarity with the Vietnamese people, seeing their fight as emblematic of oppressed peoples seeking self-determination. This global perspective fostered an international anti-war movement, with protests and demonstrations occurring in countries around the world.

# Draft
- Using at least one source from the source booklet and your own knowledge, assess the reasons why people came to oppose the Vietnam War.
Australians came to oppose the Vietnam War for a range of reasons, but the two most significant were the introduction of conscription and growing moral and ethical concerns about the nature of the war. The use of a lottery system to forcibly enlist young men into service caused widespread resentment and protest, particularly among families and youth. At the same time, many Australians began to question whether the war itself was just, especially as media reports revealed civilian suffering and controversial tactics. Overall, while moral objections grew stronger over time, it was conscription that most directly mobilised Australians into active opposition.

One of the key reasons Australians came to oppose the Vietnam War was the introduction of conscription, which forced young men to fight in a war many did not support. This had a significant impact, as it affected everyday families and led to widespread protest. ==As shown in Source A Idk something about anti-conscription, reflected the emotional and personal nature of the opposition== Under the National Service Scheme, introduced in 1964, 20-year-old men were selected by a birth date lottery to serve in the military. This system was seen as unfair, especially because wealthier individuals could often avoid service through deferments. Large-scale protests, including the Moratorium marches in 1970 and 1971, were directly influenced by public anger at conscription. The fact that these protests attracted tens of thousands of Australians shows how deeply the issue affected society. Many saw it as unacceptable to force citizens into a controversial and deadly conflict, making conscription a powerful and unifying reason for Australians to oppose the war.

In addition to opposing conscription, many Australians also came to reject the Vietnam War on moral and ethical grounds. As more information came out of the area, the war was increasing viewed as unjust, unnecessary, and harmful to innocent people. Graphic media coverage, including images of civilian casualties, napalm attacks, incidents, and the conditions for soldiers at war as shown in source A, deeply disturbed the Australian public. People began to question the legitimacy of Australia's involvement, especially since the war was seen as an internal conflict in Vietnam, not a direct threat to Australia. More images such as the infamous Napalm girl furthered the re-evaluation of Australia's involvement in the Vietnam war due to the graphic images of innocent people within Vietnam. Moral arguments were also raised by churches, unions, and students, who believed the war went against Australian values. For example, Christian groups often spoke out against the suffering inflicted on Vietnamese civilians. These ethical objections grew stronger as the war dragged on, with no clear outcome. While conscription sparked the initial wave of opposition, moral concerns gave the anti-war movement depth and longevity, convincing many Australians that the war was fundamentally wrong.

One of the key reasons Australians came to oppose the Vietnam War was the introduction of conscription, which force young men to fight in a war many did not support. This sparked intense public anger and led to the rise of a large-scale protest movement across the county. As shown in source A (hopefully a anti-conscription protest or poster), Australians were deeply concerned about the fairness of conscription as it disproporionately affected lower-income individuals who couldn't afford deferments. The National Service Scheme, introduced in 1964, used a random birth date lottery to call up 20-year-old men for two years of service. Many felt it was unjust to compel citizens to fight in a foreign conflict that did not directly threaten Australia. This sentiment was particularly strong among university students, many of whom formed groups to organise demonstrations and educate the public. In addition, the Save Our Sons movement, led by mainly mothers, campaigned to protect their children from being forced into war. These grassroots efforts showed how conscription created strong emotional and civic responses across social groups. The visible injustice and personal risk drove thousands to the streets during the Moratorium marches of 1970 and 1971, making the conscription the single most unifying cause for anti-war sentiment in Australia.

In addition to opposing conscription, many Australians rejected the Vietnam War on moral and ethical grounds, believing it was an unjustified conflict that resulted in widespread suffering and had little to do with protecting Australian values. Media coverage played a crucial role in shaping these views. Graphic television footage and newspaper images showed the devastating impact of bombings and chemical weapons like napalm on Vietnamese civilians, including women and children. Photographs such as the terror of war or colloquially known as napalm girl, shocked Australians and led many to see the war as morally indefensible. Religious leaders and humanitarian organisations also condemned the violence, Christian groups issued public statements calling for peace, arguing that the war violated basic ethical and spiritual principles Labour unions and some members of the Australian Labour Party opposed the war as well, arguing it served U.S. interest more than Australia's and betrayed principles of national sovereignty and human rights. Additionally, many Australians questioned whether their country should be involved at all. The domino theory, which claimed that communism would spread through Asia if not stopped in Vietnam, began to lose credibility as the war dragged on with no end in sight. Instead of seeing Australia as defending freedom, many came to view its involvement as blindly following American foreign policy. These ethical objections grew stronger as the war dragged on, with no clear outcome. While conscription sparked the initial wave of opposition, moral concerns gave the anti-war movement depth and longevity, convincing many Australians that the war was fundamentally wrong

## Techniques & Distinctive Features
- Frame narrative
- Allegory
- Idiom (a well known phrase, skating on thin ice)
- Chorus (The mob, Smuggles)
- Colloquial expressions (Davy Jones locker)
### Defining Frame Narrative
In a literary or storytelling context, the word 'frame' refers to a narrative structure or device where the main story serves as a framework for presenting other interconnected stories within it. It establishes a context or structure for the stories that are placed inside it, creating a layered storytelling experience.
## Planning Stage
### Step 1 - What Themes Will You Focus On?
- Identify your two themes from the following:
**Storytelling** / **Power and prejudice** / Kindness and compassion / Cruelty

### Step 2 - Collecting Evidence
Find 2-3 quotes for each of your chosen themes.

Set of quotes:

Dinarzard - "Sweet Shahrazad. If you're not too sleepy, tell us one of your lovely tales to while away the night."
"The KING OF BAGHDAD'S DAUGHTER dies and falls to the ground. Pause. KING SHAHRAYAR steps out of the story. HE surveys the bodies that surround him, and faces the human cost of his actions"
"I locked the Smuggles in the dungeon, and vowed to kill every last one of them. That vow, I see, was the vow of a beast. I, King Shahrayar, break this bad vow. Smuggles, you are free."
"King Yunan: Peasants! But I'm a king! Peasants carry germs!"
"Qasim: I'm rolling, stinking, filthy rich"

| Storytelling        | "The KING OF BAGHDAD'S DAUGHTER dies and falls to the ground. Pause. KING SHAHRAYAR steps out of the story. HE surveys the bodies that surround him, and faces the human cost of his actions" | Stage direction  | Which visually demonstrates the moment of realisation via the 'pause' in time. This demonstrates the symbolic link the king has realised between the daughter and the many smuggles he had executed. This, along with the carnage laying around him, causes him to reflect on the countless his ruthless reign has affected. Causing him to undergo anguish as he realised what his previous actions have done. Through the focus brought by the stage direction audiences can understand his emotions, and gives them a chance to draw connections with their experiences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|                     | Dinarzard - "Sweet Shahrazad. If you're not too sleepy, tell us one of your lovely tales to while away the night."                                                                            | Tone             | Initially, Shahrayar viewed the tales with indifference, allowing them to be told only at Dinarzard's request and merely enduring them. However, the softened tone now shows a more personal engagement, addressing her affectionately as 'Sweet Shahrazad' and initiating the request himself. The stories have begun to touch his heart, stripping away his deep-seated prejudices and fostering a newfound empathy. Once consumed by distrust and bitterness, the king is now opening up to Shahrazad's humanity. His previous attitude toward her, only seeing her as another smuggle, has transformed into one of genuine interest and respect. Moreover, the contrast in his tone from earlier interactions with Shahrazad reflects the power of storytelling in fostering empathy and understanding. The once ruthless and detached king, who condemned countless smuggles to death, is slowly being humanized through the art of storytelling. This transformation highlights the profound impact that stories can have on individuals and society, promoting empathy, understanding, and connection |

Smuggles, you are free."     | Metaphor         | Using a metaphor Shahrayar recognises his mistake and connects his previous acts to a beast. He reflects on these shortcomings and decides to improve himself and fix the mistakes. The metaphor also also shows how the stories have touched his heart, stripping away his deep-seated prejudices and fostering a newfound empathy. His previous attitude toward her, only seeing her as another smuggle, has transformed into one of genuine interest and respect. Moreover, this reflects the power of storytelling in fostering empathy and understanding.

| Power and prejudice | "King Yunan: Peasants! But I'm a king! Peasants carry germs!"                                                                                                                                 | Juxtaposition    | Juxtaposition is used to highlight the stark contrast between the king's elevated status and the peasants' lowly image. The king is shocked at the thought of interacting with peasants, revealing his prejudice, rooted in the stereotype that peasants are dirty and diseased. This contrast underscores the king's disdain for the common people and reflects his sense of superiority and detachment from those he rules. By placing these opposing ideas side by side, the text emphasizes the king's elitism and his unjust view of the lower class.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

It also shows prejudice against anyone who does not serve his interests. His belief that bringing aboard someone who was stranded would somehow endanger his ship or crew is a clear manifestation of this prejudice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The use of emotive words like 'stinking' suggests that Qasim's wealth has become overwhelming. To the point you could smell the money on him. The word 'filthy' further reinforces this idea, conjuring images of dirt and decay. This implies that Qasim's obsession with money has corrupted or degraded him, turning his wealth into a burden or a curse rather than a blessing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

### Step 3 - Concept Statements
[[Themes and concepts]]
Now that you know your two **Themes** and have found your examples, you will need to turn these **Themes** into **Concepts**. These will be the topic sentences of your body paragraphs.

- **Use the below guide to write your themes as concepts.**
Sophisticated English essays have a conceptual focus. This means that they go beyond the narrative and theme of the text studied, and comment on what the text is revealing about humanity. Each of your body paragraphs in an essay should focus on a concept.​

- **Theme** is defined as a main idea or an underlying meaning of a text that may be stated directly or indirectly. ​
- **Concept** is what is revealed about the theme in the text - what insight is given on the theme/issue? (There may be multiple different concepts that fall under the one theme!)​

*HOT TIP: One way to approach writing concept statements is to create connections between multiple themes.​*

For example:

| Power and prejudice | Those in power can wield their influence to marginalize and oppress others based on preconceived biases, using their prejudice to suppress those deemed inferior. Deeply ingrained prejudices can corrupt authority. |
| Storytelling        | Storytelling can teach us about the experiences of others. By observing and understanding behaviour from an outside perspective, it can help you identify shortcoming and improve yourself.                          |

**Body Paragraph - Write your own**
It is your choice whether to have 2 or 3 examples in your body paragraph, but remember that you must do this whole body paragraph structure twice.

| **Concept Statement** - Identify a concept and phrase it as a statement in response to the question.. (What does the text reveal about humans?

But I'm a king!

The king is shocked at the thought of interacting with peasants, revealing his prejudice, rooted in the stereotype that peasants are dirty and diseased. This contrast underscores the king's disdain for the common people and reflects his sense of superiority and detachment from those he rules.                                                                                                                         |

To the point you could smell the money on him. The word 'filthy' further reinforces this idea, conjuring images of dirt and decay. This implies that Qasim's obsession with money has corrupted or degraded him, turning his wealth into a burden or a curse rather than a blessing.The way that Qasim think about finding this money makes the reader feel that Qasim believes that he has "power" because he has money. |

What does the text prompt responders to consider / reflect on / question / challenge / empathise with? What does the text teach responders about the experiences of refugees?)* | In both scenes, Abela demonstrates how easily power and prejudice and corrupt authorities and cause them to begin oppressing and suppressing those they deem inferior. It teaches audiences the types of people refugees might of had to deal with. It can also help responders empathise with the experience of refugees dealing with prejudiced and extremely difficult people.                                                                                                                                        |

He reflects on these shortcomings and decides to improve himself and fix the mistakes. The metaphor also also shows how the stories have touched his heart, stripping away his deep-seated prejudices and fostering a newfound empathy. His previous attitude toward her, only seeing her as another smuggle, has transformed into one of genuine interest and respect. Moreover, this reflects the power of storytelling in fostering empathy and understanding. The once ruthless and detached king, who condemned countless smuggles to death, has been humanized through the art of storytelling. |

# Final Text
Discuss how the playwright used dramatic form/features and language techniques to convey meaning

Playwrights use dramatic form and language techniques to represent issues audiences are also facing. Donna Abela's Tales From the Arabian Nights tells the story of two sisters, Shahrazad and Dinarzard who tell stories to the violent King Shahrayar so he may open his heart and release his captured 'Smuggles.' Through dramatic form and language techniques, Abela reveals the destructive cycle of power and prejudice and provokes the audience to form connections between the story and inhumane treatment in contemporary Australia. In addition, Abela showcases the ways in which prejudice can be perpetuated by those in power.

Deeply ingrained prejudices can corrupt authority. Those in power can wield their influence to marginalize and oppress others, using their prejudice to suppress those deemed inferior. An example is when King Shahrayar acting as King Yunan has to play a game with peasants and declares "Peasants! But I'm a king! Peasants carry germs!" These exclamatory statements create juxtaposition between the king's elevated status and the peasants' lowly image. The king is shocked at the thought of interacting with peasants, revealing his prejudice, rooted in the stereotype that peasants are dirty and diseased. This contrast between Kings and peasants underscores the king's disdain for the common people and reflects his sense of superiority and detachment from those he rules. By placing these opposing ideas side by side, the text emphasizes the king's elitism and his unjust view of the lower class. He believes himself to be immune to problems due to having immense power. Additionally when a different player character Qasim finds his way into a cave full of treasures he remarks "I'm rolling, stinking, filthy rich". The use of emotive adjectives like 'stinking' suggests that Qasim's wealth has become overwhelming to the point you could smell the money on him. The adjective 'filthy' further reinforces this idea, conjuring images of dirt and decay. This implies that Qasim's obsession with money has corrupted or degraded him, turning his wealth into a burden or a curse rather than a blessing. The way that Qasim thinks about finding this money makes the reader feel that Qasim believes money grants power. It's likely this perceived power will create prejudices in him against other less wealthy people. In both scenes, Abela demonstrates how easily power and prejudice and corrupt authorities and cause them to begin oppressing and suppressing those they deem inferior. Through these allegorical tales, Abela exposes audiences to the types of people refugees may encounter. This helps responders empathise with the experience of refugees dealing with prejudiced and extremely difficult people.

Storytelling can teach us about the experiences of others. By observing and understanding behaviour from an outside perspective, it can help you identify shortcoming and improve yourself. Consider during the final act of the play when the character playing the King of Baghdad's daughter "dies and falls to the ground. Pause. KING SHAHRAYAR steps out of the story. HE surveys the bodies that surround him, and faces the human cost of his actions." Through stage direction Abela visually demonstrates a moment of realisation, via the 'pause' in time, for the king. This allows the actor playing this part to display the fact that the King has realised the symbolic link between his treatment of the smuggles and the execution of the daughter in the play. This, along with the carnage laying around him, causes him to reflect on the countless lives his ruthless reign has affected. This causes him to undergo anguish as he realises what his previous actions have done. Through the focus brought by the stage direction audiences can understand his emotions, and gives them a chance to draw connections with their experiences. This shows how storytelling can inspire empathy with the characters within the story and encourage understanding of the experiences of others. This causes us to review ourselves from the perspective of the characters and understand shortcomings. Similarly when King Shahrayar reflects on his treatment of the Smuggles, he says "I locked the Smuggles in the dungeon, and vowed to kill every last one of them. That vow, I see, was the vow of a beast. I, King Shahrayar, break this bad vow. Smuggles, you are free." Using a metaphor Shahrayar recognises his mistake and connects his previous acts to a beast. He reflects on his brutality and decides to improve himself and fix the mistakes. The metaphor also also shows how the stories have touched his heart, stripping away his deep-seated prejudices and fostering a newfound empathy. His previous attitude toward Shahrazad, only seeing her as another smuggle, has transformed into one of genuine interest and respect. Moreover, this reflects the power of storytelling in fostering empathy and understanding. The once ruthless and detached king, who condemned countless smuggles to death, has been humanized through the art of storytelling. This transformation highlights the profound impact that stories can have on individuals and society, promoting empathy, understanding, and connection. Both of these examples allow audience to connect and self-reflect through the power of story telling. Abela's use of dramatic form and language techniques by drawing connections between the behaviours of the characters in Tales from the Arabian Nights, and themselves.

Playwrights use dramatic form and language techniques to represent issues audiences are also facing. Donna Abela's contemporary play Tales From the Arabian Nights gives insight into how storytelling can provoke empathy and change, even in cases where those in positions of power exhibit extreme prejudice. Audiences are positioned to consider the impacts of their words and thoughts on others.

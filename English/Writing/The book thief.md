## Introduction
Classical texts spread messages or ideas that readers remember well after reading it. The Book Thief is a historical novel, written by Markus Zusak, it explores the journey of a Liesel Meminger a young foster girl living in Germany at the height of Nazism and during the intensity of the Second World War, and has Death as the narrator. The novel explores ideas such as the mortality and power of words. Zusak's work encourages readers to reflect on the horrors endured during the Nazi occupation of Europe and how words can change everything.
## First Body Paragraph
Words have the power to both heal and harm a person, whether directly or indirectly, spoken or read.

This harmful potential is evident when Liesel envisions the mayor's wife as physically battered after Liesel lashes out at her for ending her laundry service: "Blood leaked from her nose and licked at her lips. Her eyes had blackened. Cuts had opened up and a series of wounds were rising to the surface of her skin. All from the words. From Liesel's words." The intense imagery of the mayor's wife appearing bruised and wounded emphasises how words can inflict pain just as deeply as physical violence. The description, "blood leaked," "blackened eyes," and "cuts", transforms an emotional wound into something tangible, allowing the reader to viscerally understand the weight of Liesel's words.

Conversely, words also have the power to heal, as seen when Liesel reads aloud in the basement during a bombing raid: "She didn't dare to look up, but she could feel their frightened eyes hanging on to her as she hauled the words in and breathed them out. A voice played the notes inside her. This, it said, is your accordion." The metaphor of the accordion, specifically her foster father's accordion which he played to comfort her, demonstrates how language can provide solace in times of fear. Just as music soothes the soul, Liesel's words offer reassurance and unity to those around her. In this moment, reading aloud becomes an act of refuge, reinforcing the novel's central theme that words hold immense power, whether to wound or to heal.

This theme is further illustrated through Max's story, The Word Shaker, where he describes how words can be used to manipulate and control, but also to resist and inspire: "The best word shakers were the ones who understood the true power of words. They were the ones who could climb the highest. The tree in the story was one such example. It grew because one person believed in it." Max's allegory highlights the resilience that words can foster, suggesting that while they can be weaponized for destruction, they can also be a source of strength and defiance.

Just as Liesel's words provide comfort to those around her, Max's story symbolizes the transformative potential of language, its ability to challenge oppression and offer hope. All three of these quotes underscores the immense power of words, showing how they can both harm and heal. Liesel's journey reflects a growing understanding of this duality, as she learns to navigate the weight of her words, using them not only as a means of self-expression but as a tool for healing and resistance.
## Second Body Paragraph
Mortality is a constant presence in The Book Thief, emphasised by Death as the novel's omniscient narrator. The novel reveals that while death is unavoidable, the impact of one's life endures through memory and storytelling. Death's perspective forces readers to confront the inevitability of loss while also highlighting the beauty and fragility of life. One of the most striking instances of this theme is when Death reflects on the nature of his work, "I am haunted by humans." This paradoxical statement suggests that while humans fear Death, he, too, is burdened by their suffering. Death is not portrayed as a cruel force but rather as a weary observer, collecting souls with reluctant duty rather than malice. This personification of Death challenges the reader's perception of mortality, making it both inevitable and deeply personal.

Liesel's experiences with death, losing her brother, witnessing the horrors of war, and eventually losing her loved ones, shape her understanding of life's impermanence. Her relationship with Max also reinforces this theme, particularly when he writes in The Standover Man, "The best standover man I've ever known is not a man at all." This statement, referring to Liesel, suggests that even in a world overshadowed by death, human connection provides strength and resilience. Max, who constantly faces the threat of mortality, finds solace in Liesel's presence, demonstrating that relationships can defy death's hold by creating lasting memories. Similarly, when Death describes Liesel's book after she drops it in the rubble "I wanted to tell the book thief many things, about beauty and brutality. But what could I tell her about those things that she didn't already know?" it underscores how Liesel's experiences with loss have given her profound insight into the duality of life and death.

Yet, through words and storytelling, Liesel finds a way to preserve the memories of those she loses, proving that while death may take lives, it cannot erase their impact. The novel ultimately suggests that mortality is not just about loss but about how people are remembered and the legacies they leave behind. By capturing stories and treasuring human connections, The Book Thief argues that even in the face of death, life's meaning endures.
## Conclusion
Classical texts spread messages readers engage with, cause them to think about and potentially internalise these messages. Markus Zusak's historical novel gives insight on how words can heal and harm and how the impact of one's life endures through memory and storytelling. Audiences are positioned to consider the impacts of their words on others and how their life's impacts endure through memory and storytelling.

Classical texts leave lasting impressions on readers through powerful messages and ideas. Markus Zusak's historical novel, The Book Thief, is narrated by death and follows Liesel Meminger, a young foster girl in Nazi Germany. The novel explores themes of mortality and the power of words, encouraging reflection on the horrors of war and the transformative nature of language.

Words possess the power to heal or harm, whether spoken or read. This destructive capability is evident when Liesel imagines the mayor's wife physically battered after she lashes out at her: "Blood leaked from her nose and licked at her lips. Her eyes had blackened. Cuts had opened up and a series of wounds were rising to the surface of her skin. All from the words. From Liesel's words." The imagery of bruises and wounds emphasises how words inflict pain as deeply as physical violence, making emotional wounds tangible.

A voice played the notes inside her. This, it said, is your accordion." The metaphor of the accordion, symbolising her foster father's music, illustrates how words offer solace. Further reinforcing the power of words is when Liesel thinks, "Without words, the Führer was nothing." This statement highlights how words are the foundation of both oppression and resistance, demonstrating their ability to shape reality itself. Through these instances, the novel underscores the profound and multifaceted impact of language—its ability to wound, console, and unite.

Mortality is a constant presence in The Book Thief, emphasised by Death's omniscient narration. The novel asserts that while death is inevitable, life's impact endures through memory and storytelling. Death's perspective forces readers to confront loss while appreciating life's fragility. One of the most striking instances of this theme is Death's reflection: "I am haunted by humans." This paradox suggests that while humans fear Death, he, too, is burdened by their suffering. Death is not depicted as cruel but as a weary observer, collecting souls with reluctant duty rather than malice. This personification challenges perceptions of mortality, making it deeply personal. Liesel's encounters with death—losing her brother, witnessing war's destruction, and eventually losing her loved ones—shape her understanding of life's impermanence. Her relationship with Max reinforces this theme, particularly when he writes in The Standover Man, "The best standover man I've ever known is not a man at all." This statement, referring to Liesel, employs irony by subverting the expectation that a "standover man" must be male and physically imposing. It also presents a paradox, as it appears contradictory but ultimately reveals the strength found in unexpected places. This line highlights how human connection provides strength even in a world overshadowed by death. Max, constantly facing mortality, finds solace in Liesel's presence, proving relationships can defy death's hold through memory and love. Similarly, when Death describes Liesel's book after she drops it in the rubble—"I wanted to tell the book thief many things, about beauty and brutality. But what could I tell her about those things that she didn't already know?"—it underscores how her experiences with loss grant her profound insight into life and death. Through storytelling, Liesel preserves the memories of those she loses, proving that while death takes lives, it cannot erase their impact. Ultimately, The Book Thief suggests mortality is not just about loss but about remembrance and legacy. By capturing stories and valuing human connections, the novel argues that even in the face of death, life's meaning endures.

Classical texts resonate with readers by provoking thought and emotional engagement. Zusak's novel emphasizes the profound impact of words and storytelling, prompting readers to reflect on the power of language and the lasting influence of those who came before them.

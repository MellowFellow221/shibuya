# Essay Structure
## Ingredients of an Introduction
Don't have to be in this order, think of this like a checklist.
- **Identify the value of plays to represent contemporary issues**
- Introduce the text & composer and briefly summarise it.
- *Answer the question and identify the ideas (concepts) in the text that you will explore.*
- ==Provide the 'reason' - why is the composer presenting these ideas? What do they want responders to learn? What perspective on the world is the text prompting audiences to reject, challenge or accept?==
Thesis = **bold** + *italics* + ==highlight==
### Example Introduction
**Playwrights use conventions of drama to represent issues that audiences can relate to.** Donna Abela Tales From the Arabian Nights tells the story of two sisters, Shahrazad and Dinarzard who trick the violent King Shahrayar into sparing their lives and releasing his captured 'Smuggles.' *Through dialogue and stage directions, Abela reveals the power of storytelling to change people for the better.* ==This provokes the audience to empathise with the plight of refugees held in detention in Australia.==
## Body Paragraph Structure
Each body paragraph should focus on a **concept (idea about a theme).** You will need to explore TWO-THREE concepts in the text = TWO-THREE body paragraphs in total. Each body paragraph should follow the structure below.

- <span style="color:f38ba8">Concept statement: Identify a concept and phrase it as a statement in response to the question. </span>(What does the text reveal about humans? What insight does it give on humanity and human nature?)

You will need to provide 2-3 examples (scenes) from the text that support your concept statement.
For each example, you will need to do the following:
- <span style="color:f9e2af">Provide a contextualised example (quote) that portrays the concept.</span>
- <span style="color:fab387">Identify a language feature/technique and/or a stage direction and explain its effect on the responder.</span>
- <span style="color:89b4fa">Interpret what this example reveals about the concept.</span>

At the end of the paragraph, you will need to:
- <span style="color:a6e3a1">Evaluate the significance of the concept to responders, linking back to the question.</span> (So what? What does the text prompt responders to consider/reflect on/question/challenge/empathise with etc. What does the text teach responders about the experiences of refugees?)
### Example Body Paragraph
C-grade paragraph, needs more analysis

<span style="color:f38ba8">While showing kindness and empathy is a simple practice, its impact can be significant. </span><span style="color:f9e2af">In the opening scene of the play, Queen Sahar shows compassion towards the Smuggles as she justifies welcoming them into the kingdom into a furious King Shahraya, "It cost nothing to open the gate".</span><span style="color:fab387"> The oxymoron of 'cost nothing' emphasises how easy it is</span> <span style="color:89b4fa">to be kind rather than vengeful or hurtful.</span><span style="color:f9e2af"> Similarly, in the Tale of the Fisherman, the poor fisherman shows kindness to the coloured fish by convincing the demon to tun them back into humans.</span><span style="color:fab387"> The stage direction "the four COLOURED FISH turn into people and rejoice" allows the audience to see</span><span style="color:89b4fa"> they joy that kindness and compassion can create.</span><span style="color:a6e3a1"> In both scenes, Abela demonstrates that kindness is important if we want to live in a world that values justice and believes all people should be treated farily and shown compassion for their circumstances.</span>
## Ingredients of a Conclusion
- <span style="color:f9e2af">Restate your thesis in response to the question.</span>
- **Briefly re-cap the concepts explored in your body paragraphs.**
- *Provide an appreciative/evaluative that addresses why the composer is presenting these issues. What do they want responders to learn, in relation to the question?*
### Example Conclusion
<span style="color:f9e2af">Playwrights use the conventions of drama to explore important issues that affect humanity.</span> **Donna Abela's contemporary play gives insight into how stories can evoke positive change**. *Audiences are therefore positioned to consider the impacts of their own words and how words have the power to create change.*

## Turning Themes into Concept Statements
Sophisticated English essays have a conceptual focus. This means that they go beyond the narrative and theme of the text studied, and comment on what the text is revealing about humanity. Each of your body paragraphs in an essay should focus on a **concept**.
- **Theme** is defined as a main idea or an underlying meaning of a text that may be stated directly or indirectly.
- **Concept** is what is revealed about the theme in the text - what insight is given on the theme/issue? (There may be multiple different concepts that fall under the one theme!)

> [!Hot tip]
> One way to approach writing concept statements is to create connections between multiple themes.

For example:

| Themes                                 | Concepts                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Power and prejudice + cruelty          | - An individual's lust for power can increase their capacity for cruelty and willingness to partake in discrimination.<br>- To hold onto their power and authority, individuals often sacrifice their mortality. |
| Storytelling + kindness and compassion | - Storytelling can teach us about the experiences of others, prompting us to have greater understanding of and empathy with them.                                                                                |

- Intertextuality refers to those interrelationships among texts that shape a text's meaning. The recognizable echoes of other texts in a text intensify the experience of the text by adding layers of meaning.
***Types of intertextuality:***
- **Explicit intertextuality**, alluding specifically to another text through quotation or reference
- **Implied intertextuality**, where allusion is more indirect may occur through such commonalities as genre or style
- **Inferred intertextuality** referring to the texts drawn on by the actual responder and will likely include texts that had not even existed when the text was composed.

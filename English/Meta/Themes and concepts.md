# Themes and Concepts
- **Theme** is defined as a main idea or an underlying meaning of a text that may be stated directly or indirectly. In this case, our themes are the 'issues' that we will be referring to as part of the essay.
- **Concept** is what is revealed about the theme in the text - what insight is given on the theme/issue? (There may be multiple different concepts that fall under the one theme!)
For example:
- **Theme:**
	- Stereotypes of masculinity.
- **Concepts:**
	- Because of social pressures to appear manly and brave, men often hide their emotions.
	- Intelligence and sensitivity are undervalued qualities in men.

Sophisticated English essays have a conceptual focus. This means that they go beyond the narrative and theme of the text studied, and comment on what the text is revealing about humanity. Remember, the purpose of this unit is for students to investigate how narratives operate as vehicles for communicating values, arguments and ideas about broad aspects of humanity, society and culture. Through the close study of a novel, they will consider textual elements such as plot structure, characterisation and themes.
- Students understand how values are embedded in narratives through selection of details of events and characters and language choices.
Each of your body paragraphs in an essay should focus on a concept, which is outlined in a concept statement. This takes the place of a topic sentence at the beginning of each paragraph.
## The Power of Words
- Words have the power to both heal and harm a person, whether that be directly or indirectly, spoken or read.
- The power of words lies in its ability to influence the minds of others and can be used to further benevolent or malevolent ideals.
## Man's Capacity for Cruelty and Kindness
- Morals are shaped through an individual's experiences with others, informing their capacity for cruelty and kindness.
- An individual's lust for power can determine their capacity for cruelty and willingness to partake in discrimination.
- In the pursuit of self-preservation and power, individuals may partake in discriminatory behaviour that conflicts with their morals.
- In the face of immense cruelty, it is small acts of kindness that give us home.
- Small acts of kindness can give us hope in even the direst of situations.
	- Giving the piece of bread to the marching Jews, from [[The book thief]]
## Perseverance
- One's ability to persevere is determined by the strength of their support network.
- In difficult times, we lean on those closest to us to provide us the strength to persevere/survive.
- It takes incredible willpower to survive.
- One's capacity for perseverance is dictated by their values and ideals.
- One's ability to survive is determined by their conviction and guilt.
## Mortality
- The reckless pursuit of power can result in the loss of millions of precious human lives, each with their own families, ambitions and dreams.
- The universal experience of loss influences how we live, resulting in us acting out of fear.
- The universal experience of loss influences can bring us closer together, as we hold onto our loved ones for support.
- Mortality is the fact that everyone is ultimately frail and can be easily broken or shattered.

# The Filmmaker's Lens
How does the cinematic medium enable composers to explore their unique perspective of common concepts?
## Film Trailer - Viewing Questions
*After watching the trailer…*
- Can we infer the concepts the film will explore from its trailer?
Yes, concepts such as loyalty, betrayal, power and corruption.
- **Are there similarities in characters or settings?**
Molly is similar to Lady Macbeth as she was a catalyst for major events, ended herself due to overwhelming guilt, love interest of the protagonist.
Stephen plays a similar role as Macbeth having large amounts of ambition, starting with ethical actions before slowing radicalising, stabs his best friend (Paul) in the back.
Duffy is like the witches driving Stephens ambition and giving him a vision to work to, which corrupts him and causes him to betray those around him.
- **How do these concepts connect with those that are broached in the play?**
Concepts like loyalty, betrayal, ambition and how power corrupts directly connect between the film and the play. With characters playing similar roles between the movie and the play.
- **What parallels can you draw between the plot of the film and that of the play?**
The concepts and themes are similar with both focusing on a main character told about a prosperous future which causes them to have a high level of ambition later ending with them being corrupted and betraying everyone who they cared about. Characters also hold similar relevance, Molly playing Lady Macbeth's role, Stephen playing Macbeth's role and Duffy playing the role of the witches.
# Context - Ides of March
The **Ides of March** is the day on the Roman calendar marked as the *Idus*, roughly the midpoint of a month, of Martius, corresponding to 15 March on the Gregorian calendar. It was marked by several major religious observance. In 44 BC, it became notorious as the date of the assassination of Julius Caesar, which made the Ides of March a turning point in Roman history.
Julius Caesar was assassinated by a group of senators during a meeting of the Senate at the Curia of Pompey of the Theatre of Pompey in Rome where senators stabbed Caesar 23 time. They claimed to be acting over fears that Caesar's unprecedented concentration of power during his dictatorship was undermining the Roman Republic. At least 60 to 70 senators were party to the conspiracy, led by Marcus Junius Brutus, Gaius Cassius Longinus, and Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus. Despite the death of Caesar, the conspirators were unable to restore the institutions of the Republic. The ramifications of the assassination led to his martyrdom, the Liberators' civil war and ultimately to the Principate period of the Roman Empire.
- **How might this historical event connect with the themes explored in Shakespeare's Macbeth**
Themes such as loyalty, betrayal and a grab for power are shared by both the historical event and Macbeth.

However we are privy to the fact that the lines have been pre-written for him, calling into question his authenticit                                                         | Closeup showing little emotion on Stephen's face and how he doesn't truly care what he is talking about. Flipping between Duffy and Paul awkwardly smiling at each other showing their strained relationship and how they often work near each other but are directly competing so can't be friends. | Non-diegetic fast pace marching band drums.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Harsh light on Stephen's face, Mike Morris half lit up showing his double persona.                                                                                                           | Molly fetching coffees setting the scene for the power imbalance between the intern and the rest of the collective. Everyone is in suits and dressed, very formal occasion/area.                                                   |
| Ida and Stephen meet 6:00-10:45                          | Stephen - "Ida, I'm not naive… This is the one… The truth is, he's the only one who's gonna actually make a difference in people's lives… If Mike Morris is president, it says more about us than it does about him." - irony, power and ambition. Ida - "Mike Morris is a politician. He's a nice guy… he will let you down, sooner or later…" - foreshadowing the corruption to come.                                                     | Many medium shots flipping between the characters in conversation.

Dialogue showing Stephen and Paul's relationship with Ida, she talks mainly about what they are trying to do gathering information as she is press and it's mainly a work relationship.              | Harsher shadows on Stephen compared to Ida so we can see her reaction more prominently.                                                                                                      | Older formal bar, everyone sitting down talking to each other showing equality.                                                                                                                                                    |

I've got Morris." - shows Stephen is an idealist, wants to act morally/ethically. Duffy - "I've been in the business 25 years and I've seen way too many Democrats bite the dust because they wouldn't get down into the mud with the fucking elephants."                                                                                                   | Closeup on both faces showing reactions. Camera slowly zooming onto Stephen's face every cut, closer to him than Duffy's. Duffy's camera angles are more aggressive he keeps moving forward while Stephen's are tighter showing he knows less but is still interested in what Duffy has to say.      | Non-diegetic marching band from earlier but in a minor tone and slower. More tense and less excited. Diegetic dialogue low voices/whispering trying not to be noticed. Diegetic slow and thumping music with a curious under track while talking to Paul about what just happened. | Duffy is in dark lighting showing he is doing something he shouldn't be. Once in the bar they both have split lighting on the face showing they are both equally in the wrong after meeting. | Shabbier bar, with less lights and no musician                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Charlie Rose interview (abortion) 25:00-26:00            | Morris - "I can't see myself, or anyone, certainly not a government, telling a woman what she can do without her body." Morris's views on abortion - dramatic irony. (Juxtaposed with Stephen forcing Molly to later have abortion to protect Morris.) Morris - "Society has to be better than the individual." - justifying his hypocrisy (Fate and free will? Corruption?) - brings into question his authenticity and trustworth  ss.    | Closeup on Morris and Charlie Rose just basic reactions. Cuts to Stephen smiling due to having the lines he wrote for Morris being delivered correctly.                                                                                                                                              | Dialogue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Brighter lights on the Morris and Charlie Rose while everyone else is darker as they are less important. What Morris is talking about is stark and the scene shows that.                     | Bright round table where the interview is being conducted. Darker backstage for everyone watching this go over.                                                                                                                    |
| Stephen & Molly at the bar & morning after - 26:0032:00  | Molly - "How old do you think I am?…20" Stephen - "That's young." Molly - "Is that too young…?" Surprisingly, they're very lax about their child endangerment laws. This exchange emphasises their age gap. She uses her youth as an enticement for Stephen, playing up her subservience and weakness as a young woman. Stephen - "You're mature aren't you?" Molly - "For a teenager." - emphasises her youth and the power imba  lance.   | Close up on both faces showing them scanning each others faces and intimately looking at each other. Both know they are doing the wrong thing. Medium shot holding from the corner of the room. Like a rat watching what is happening. Shots watching each character get dressed.                    | Diegetic slow paced piano, intimacy. Talking about age differences and power differences shows why Molly is looking for this relationship, power. Diegetic Duffy on the TV talking about polling. Talking about how they got into the position to have sex with each other.        | Low key warm lighting,  highlights Stephen and Molly's faces. Contrasts darker bar.

| Plane scene - 32:00-34:00                                | Stephen - "There's a big difference between Paul and me. Paul only believes in winning so he'll do or say anything to win… I'll do or say anything… but I have to believe in the cause." - reveals his trust and belief in Morris as a worthy candidate for the presidency.                                                                                                                                                                 | Medium shots flipping between Stephen and Morris.

Stephen - "I met with Tom Duffy yesterday." very rushed and low understands he made a mistake. Paul - "Oh, it doesn't matter what you fucking thought! It matters what you did! It matters what you didn't do!" also speaking fast and angry at Stephen because what he did was a big mistake. mistake. | Low medium shot Paul is in the centre showing more power more important.

Morris talking about not giving money to the rich contrasts between what he says vs what he is (rich man benefiting from the system).            | Outlines on both characters.

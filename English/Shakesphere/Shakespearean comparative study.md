# Shakespearean Comparative Study
**One of these may be an essay question**
- How do creative minds seek to represent the same concepts differently?
- What has changed culturally or historically to 'shift' the lens we see concepts through?
- How do conceptual connections allow us to draw parallels and conclusions about the importance of context?
- How do similarities and differences between texts reflect, challenge or subvert contextual values and concepts?
- How are concepts adapted across context to represent new or shared ideas and values?
**Probably the essay question**
- Has your comparative study revealed more similarities between the ways the composers of your texts explore common concepts and ideas, or differences?
Comparative studies between texts reveal the different ways composer's can explore common concepts and ideas. The comparative study between Macbeth and the Ides of March reveals more similarities than differences in the way each composer has explored shared concepts and ideas.

# Shakespearean Comparative Study
**One of these may be an essay question**
- How do creative minds seek to represent the same concepts differently?
- What has changed culturally or historically to 'shift' the lens we see concepts through?
- How do conceptual connections allow us to draw parallels and conclusions about the importance of context?
- How do similarities and differences between texts reflect, challenge or subvert contextual values and concepts?
- How are concepts adapted across context to represent new or shared ideas and values?
**Probably the essay question**
- After Shakespeare died, his friend Ben Johnson said "He was not for an age, but for all time." Compare the texts you have studied in class to evaluate the enduring value of the themes they explore.
In your response you must reference the SHAKESPEAREAN PLAY AND the FILM you have studied in class.
In responding to the question, you will be expected to include supporting evidence such as: examples/quotes from both texts and analysis of relevant literary, theatrical, and cinematic techniques.

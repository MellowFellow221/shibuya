# Shakespearean Comparative Study
Exam is based around comparing Macbeth and the Ides of March. Surrounding either how have the themes and their portrayal have changed due to culture/creator or how the themes reflect certain elements in the real world. Kind of also how has the text changed how we see the theme.
**One of these may be an essay question**
- How do creative minds seek to represent the same concepts differently?
- What has changed culturally or historically to 'shift' the lens we see concepts through?
- How do conceptual connections allow us to draw parallels and conclusions about the importance of context?
- How do similarities and differences between texts reflect, challenge or subvert contextual values and concepts?
- How are concepts adapted across context to represent new or shared ideas and values?

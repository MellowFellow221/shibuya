# Macbeth
links: [[020 English Resources]], [[Shakespeare retold]]
## Act 1, Scene 3: The Witches Unfinished
- Macbeth and Banquo hear the same prophecies from the witches - but they react in different ways. Why is Macbeth so moved?
- The witches speak dangerous thoughts that Macbeth is thinking about himself. This is probably the most important point. His reaction is as if someone has read his mind.
- Macbeth immediately takes on step towards the kingship. Macbeth is excited by the witches' words.
Referring to quotes and techniques (in the original script), how does Shakespeare establish the characterisation of:
### The Witches
The witches are characterised as aloof and untrustworthy, manipulative and deliberately ambiguous. This is clean when they speak in paradoxes such as "not so happy, yet much happier". The witches seem to target the weakness of people. They symbolise the disruption of the natural order.
### Macbeth
Portrayed as curious and needs reassurance that his own ideals are accurate. He is ambitious and desires glory. He is also naive and irrational as his moral judgement is clouded by his own greed for power.

Supporting Quote/s: "Speak, if you can: what are you?" Curious
### Banquo
Banquo represents a morally sound individual. He is rational and questions the witches' credibility. This foreshadows Banquo will be "greater" than Macbeth. Banquo at times represents what Macbeth could have been if he had not succumbed to his own folly.
## Act 1, Scene 7: Before the Murder
- Did Macbeth really want to kill Duncan? The following evidence suggests Macbeth was acting of his own freewill.
- His excuses show he does still really want the crown. He says he is enjoying the feeling of being famous and powerful.
- Lady Macbeth's persuasion quickly works on him. It does not take him long to submit to Lady Macbeth's taunts, even though they are so harsh.
- By the end, he has taken over the planning himself. He temporarily loses his doubt and fear.
### Unpacking Macbeth's Soliloquy: "If it Were Done when 'tis done"
- Macbeth leaves the state dinner to contemplate their plans. He wishes the act could be straightforward , but knows there will be consequences. He also acknowledges that he is breaching his duty to Duncan by betraying him thus (a big no-no during the Elizabethan era):
- Duncan is a relative and his king, and an assassination was seen as a crime against God: "I am his kinsman and his subject"
- Duncan is his guest and he should protect Duncan, not murder him - in the middle ages, when the play is set, it was a particular imperative of the code of chivalry that the host protect his guest from danger: "as his host, who should against his murderer shut the door, not bear the knife myself."
- Duncan is a good king ("this Duncan hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been so clear in his great office, that his virtues will plead like angels") and that his murder would cause universal sadness ("tears shall drown the wind")
- Macbeth acknowledges that he wants too much, and has only ambition to justify his actions.
### Characterisation: Macbeth and Lady Macbeth
- After his soliloquy in which he reveals his conflict over their plans, Macbeth attempts to confront Lady Macbeth with his decision not to go through with their plans to kill Duncan. His reason: he has earned the good opinion of his peers and he wants to enjoy it for what it is ("He hath honour'd me of late, and I have bought Golden opinions from all sorts of people, which would be worn now in their newest gloss, Not cast aside so soon").
- Lady Macbeth is expectedly furious. She uses Macbeth's love to emotionally blackmail him: "From this time such I account thy love". She also questions his manhood and accuses him of cowardice, exploiting his sensitivity about his manliness. She rallies him by going over their plans.
- Macbeth admires her fierce courage (" Bring forth men-children only, for thy undaunted mettle should compose nothing but but males.")
## Act 2, Scene 3: After the Murder
- Which emotions might Macbeth be feeling four hours after the murder? In this scene he shows a strange mixture, and it is hard to tell sometimes because his speech is so ambiguous.
- **Fear and shock**
- At the start of the scene, Macbeth is tense and edgy. He is trapped between the door and Lennox's speech, and seems unable to say more than brief, formal statements.
- **Guilt and regret**
- Many of Macbeth's words suggest he is feeling these emotions after the murder.
- **Threat, menace, power and control**
- What Macbeth says has a lot of menace in it. By the end of the scene he could be enjoying the shock and distress he has caused. His words have a dark double meaning.
## Act 3, Scene 4: The Banquet
- Macbeth is tense and anxious as he enters the banquet. It's important to think about this point because it will help you to understand how his mind could conjure up the terrible image of the ghost.
- Macbeth is sick with worry and guilt about Banquo's murder. This is important. Banquo was his best friend, and Macbeth has ordered him to be killed. He needed both Banquo and Fleance dead, but Fleance has escaped. This throws Macbeth into a panic.
- Macbeth is acting secretly. He is not communicating with Lady Macbeth. This is an important point. Macbeth has started to exclude his wife from his decisions. Acting alone puts extra pressure on him - and on their relationship.
- The banquet is supposed to confirm Macbeth as a fitting king. This is the first public function since Macbeth's coronation, and he needs the important guests, who are potentially his enemies, to feel at ease because he is in control. When it starts to go wrong, he is desperate to calm the.
- **The effect of the ghost on Macbeth**
- Macbeth's reaction to the ghost occurs in three distinct phases.
- He is terrified and cowers from it. At first Macbeth is terrified, because he simply cannot understand the reappearance of Banquo. Why do the dead not stay dead?
- He challenges it. The second time the ghost appears, Macbeth takes it on - he confronts the ghosts to overcome his feelings of terror and guilt. He seems to win - the ghost disappears.
- Macbeth puts his faith in the supernatural, his marriage is no longer the source of his strength. This is a real turning point. It's as if he gives up trying to control things, and makes up his mind to go back to the witches. It's an admission he is beaten. We seem to know the play will end tragically from this point.
## Act 5, Scene 5: Lady Macbeth's Death
- How is Macbeth affected when he learns of his wife's death?
- Macbeth seems suddenly weary when Lady Macbeth dies. His reaction is strange - quiet, subdued and thoughtful.
- His power and motivation seem to banish. It's as if Macbeth no longer sees any point trying to hold onto the kingship. He cannot understand why he ever wanted it.
- He realises this is the end and his own death is near. We get the impression he now knows he will die, even though the witches seem to have told him otherwise. The strange thing is, he just seems to accept it.
# The Filmmaker's Lens
How does the cinematic medium enable composers to explore their unique perspective of common concepts?
## Film Trailer - Viewing Questions
*After watching the trailer...*
- Can we infer the concepts the film will explore from its trailer?
Yes, concepts such as loyalty, betrayal, power and corruption.
- **Are there similarities in characters or settings?**
Molly is similar to Lady Macbeth as she was a catalyst for major events, ended herself due to overwhelming guilt, love interest of the protagonist.
Stephen plays a similar role as Macbeth having large amounts of ambition, starting with ethical actions before slowing radicalising, stabs his best friend (Paul) in the back.
Duffy is like the witches driving Stephens ambition and giving him a vision to work to, which corrupts him and causes him to betray those around him.
- **How do these concepts connect with those that are broached in the play?**
Concepts like loyalty, betrayal, ambition and how power corrupts directly connect between the film and the play. With characters playing similar roles between the movie and the play.
- **What parallels can you draw between the plot of the film and that of the play?**
The concepts and themes are similar with both focusing on a main character told about a prosperous future which causes them to have a high level of ambition later ending with them being corrupted and betraying everyone who they cared about. Characters also hold similar relevance, Molly playing Lady Macbeth's role, Stephen playing Macbeth's role and Duffy playing the role of the witches.
# Context - Ides of March
The **Ides of March** is the day on the Roman calendar marked as the *Idus*, roughly the midpoint of a month, of Martius, corresponding to 15 March on the Gregorian calendar. It was marked by several major religious observance. In 44 BC, it became notorious as the date of the assassination of Julius Caesar, which made the Ides of March a turning point in Roman history.
Julius Caesar was assassinated by a group of senators during a meeting of the Senate at the Curia of Pompey of the Theatre of Pompey in Rome where senators stabbed Caesar 23 time. They claimed to be acting over fears that Caesar's unprecedented concentration of power during his dictatorship was undermining the Roman Republic. At least 60 to 70 senators were party to the conspiracy, led by Marcus Junius Brutus, Gaius Cassius Longinus, and Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus. Despite the death of Caesar, the conspirators were unable to restore the institutions of the Republic. The ramifications of the assassination led to his martyrdom, the Liberators' civil war and ultimately to the Principate period of the Roman Empire.
- **How might this historical event connect with the themes explored in Shakespeare's Macbeth**
Themes such as loyalty, betrayal and a grab for power are shared by both the historical event and Macbeth.

# Shakespeare Retold
**Play** - Macbeth
**Film** - The Ides of March
Why do creative minds seek to represent the same concepts differently?
## Unit Overview
- You will study a Shakespearean play and a feature film to explore meaningful connections between the texts.
- You will examine the similarities and differences in the ideas and values each text presents. focusing on how key themes are shown differently across different forms and times.
- You will also consider how an artist's context shapes the messages they convey, and how ideas and values reflect the society in which the text was created.
- You will build on what you already know about drama by focusing on context and form. Throughout this unit, you will deepen your understanding of how universal concepts are represented through dramatic and cinematic techniques.
## Unit Guiding Questions
**One of these may be an essay question**
- How do creative minds seek to represent the same concepts differently?
- What has changed culturally or historically to 'shift' the lens we see concepts through?
- How do conceptual connections allow us to draw parallels and conclusions about the importance of context?
- How do similarities and differences between texts reflect, challenge or subvert contextual values and concepts?
- How are concepts adapted across context to represent new or shared ideas and values?
## Key Terms
1. **Composer:** Used in extended responses as a catch-all term for 'creative-minds': authors, playwrights, artists, film directors and song writers.
2. **Represent:** To creatively depict a thing, person, or idea. Representations do not mirror reality, but offer a different - often unique - construction of the world.
3. **Perspective:** A particular attitude towards or way of regarding something; a point of view.
4. **Concepts:** A broad or abstract idea, of which we could find many examples through history and literature. Concepts bind the diversity of experience through the common threads of their shared qualities. E.g. 'family', 'survival', 'authority'.
5. **Theme:** A text's themes are its recurring ideas. These can be as broad as any concept, or as specific as a 'lesson' or message. It can be useful to think about broad ' thematic' concepts and the thematic statements made about those concepts.

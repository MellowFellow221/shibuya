# Can You Hear Me
1. **Comment on the directors' use of diegetic sound to drive the narration of the plot.**
Diegetic sound is used in the beginning of the film to show what the old lady is hearing to show what her life has been like without the hearing aid, all sounds being heavily muffled and being extremely hard to make out. Once the hearing aid is put in all diegetic sounds are boosted and we experience the happiness she can to hear everything most people don't notice.
2. **Explain how the directors' use of TWO distinctive camera angles or movements are used to show tension.**
Close up of the Nan when she puts the hearing aid in during tea time and begins to hear all the terrible things her family have been saying about her. This is a distinct change in mood from the happiness she was experiencing when her family came in to the stress when she learns they are only around to take all of her money. Near the end there is another close up revealing to the audience that Nan has one the lotto as she looks up from her card and a large smile appears on her face.
3. **Identify a theme in the film and explain how the theme is conveyed through the use of cinematography.**
The theme of greed is used as a theme. The characters are an oxymoron of each other, Nan is extremely kind and offers up her home for an afternoon tea, while her family are extremely greedy only coming over to pretend to like her while actually just waiting for her to die so they are able to take her home. Though dialogue we can see this as almost all they family are talking about money and then when she wins the lotto immediately they exclaim 'we won the lotto' rather than she did.
4. **Explain how the director creates a comedic tone.**
The comedic tone comes in in the end once Nan learns she has won the lottery and takes insulting photos on one of the daughters phones. The images of an old lady smiling and flipping off a camera in a selfie while eating the winning lottery ticket is a drastic contrast against the more downbeat story.

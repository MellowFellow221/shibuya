1. **Describe how a theme is conveyed in the film.**
The theme of family issues is conveyed through the story.
2. **Analyse the impact of the opening baking montage. Identify two film techniques used to create meaning.**
The opening baking montage uses close ups and upbeat non-diegetic music to create the feeling that what they are baking is incredibly important.

The non-diegetic music furthers this understanding using slow upbeat music so we can feel the love she puts in to makes sure this is perfect.

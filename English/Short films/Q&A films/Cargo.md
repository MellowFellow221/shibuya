1. **What emotions are evoked in the film's opening scene**
Emotions of worry, fear and curiosity. *(would be a low mark question, no need to go past*) We start the scene being unable to see anything or hear anything, growing the curiosity in the watcher, then we see a lady next to him growling and reaching for him while as we being to understand that the world has become a zombie apocalypse.
2. **Explain how a combination of THREE film techniques are used to instil that emotion into the audience.**
A closeup is used when the character has fallen in a field of grass showing pain as we see it on his face and with his hand making a tight fist around bundles of grass. This instils the emotion of worry into the audience, worry of what will happen to the character, his baby and how he will continue to make his way to the safe zone. Another close up is used at the start as the main character removes the female sticker from the group of family sticker on his car, instilling sadness as it is reveal the zombie he killed was his wife.
3. **Identify one SYMBOLIC prop and explain what it symbolises.**
The balloon symbolises hope and purity
4. **What is the setting of this story and what are the ways in which the setting contributes to the story being told? Could this story be told in any other time or place?**
The setting of the story is the Australian bush the setting contributes to the isolation and tension in the film. The setting helps with the idea that the world has been faced with an apocalypse as we go past a abandoned birthday party with no one around. The story is able to be told in other ways and places for instance it would still work in the woods or in previous times without having a dramatic effect on the film.

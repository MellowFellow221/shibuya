1. What genre/s do you think this film adheres to? Justify your answer with TWO pieces of textual evidence.
This film is horror, you can see this from the close-ups and POV shot. In the middle of the film we watch the slaughter of pigs for their organs. It uses a close up of multiple dead pigs in a cage and dead hanging pigs which get cut down the middle and organs taken out. There is also a POV shot from a news reporter looking at a subject who is arguing about his rights before being shot in the head. Both of these would be considered scary to most audiences and the film classified as horror as we watch scary things.
2. Explain the effect of the hand-held camera movement in the protests/riot scene.
The hand-held camera movement makes the scene much more believable as footage from riots often look like that. This causes responders to believe in the scene as normally if a protest goes wrong footage becomes shaky. The shaky footage also causes worry in responders as it is unpredictable and jumpy.
3. Describe TWO instances of diegetic sound
